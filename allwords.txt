in
the

pages
we
propose
to
consider
at
some
little
length
the
state
of
zoological
knowledge
in
the
middle
ages
and
in
so
doing
we
shall
we
doubt
not
discover
much
of
interest
while
we
shall
undoubtedly
find
from
time
to
time
strange
errors
that
greater
opportunity
of
observation
has
in
these
latter
days
rectified
and
encounter
many
things
that
may
provoke
a
smile
we
must
in
the
forefront
of
our
remarks
very
definitely
assert
that
much
of
the
literary
work
of
our
ancestors
in
this
branch
of
study
is
worthy
of
high
commendation
and
that
anything
approaching
scorn
or
sneer
is
entirely
out
of
place
strange
indeed
would
it
be
if
the
modern
man
of
science
with
all
the
advantages
of
travel
now
so
freely
available
with
the
microscope
with
the
great
facilities
for
the
interchange
of
ideas
or
of
specimens
with
kindred
spirits
had
not
made
a
marked
advance
but
we
can
never
look
upon
the
works
of
the
greater
writers
of
the
medi
val
period
without
the
utmost
respect
the
common
people
of
that
day
were
eagerly
searching
after
knowledge
and
the
huge
folios
and
encyclop
dias
that
were
freely
published
are
a
monument
of
the
diligence
and
painstaking
zeal
of
the
courage
and
enthusiasm
of
their
teachers
that
they
made
mistakes
goes
without
saying
but
to
the
full
extent
of
their
light
they
were
honest
seekers
after
truth
while
the
statements
of
these
early
writers
have
been
too
frequently
dismissed
as
fabulous
and
unreliable
it
is
only
just
to
them
to
recall
the
fact
that
some
of
the
details
that
have
come
into
reproach
have
after
all
been
found
authentic
sir
emerson
tennant
in
his
work
on
ceylon
very
justly
observes
that
we
ought
not
to
be
too
hasty
in
casting
ridicule
upon
the
narratives
of
ancient
travellers
in
a
geographical
point
of
view
they
possess
great
value
and
if
sometimes
they
contain
statements
which
appear
marvellous
the
mystery
is
often
explained
away
by
a
more
minute
and
careful
enquiry
the
troglodytes
mentioned
by
pliny
aristotle
and
herodotus
yet
exist
in
the
bosjesmen
of
to
day
and
still
preserve
many
of
the
peculiarities
and
customs
that
those
early
writers
described
du
chaillu
rediscovered
the
gorillas
that
hanno
the
ancient
carthaginian
endeavoured
to
capture
and
stanley
encountered
the
pigmy
tribes
that
are
mentioned
by
travellers
of
a
thousand
years
before
we
accept
in
full
faith
the
statements
of
such
men
as
captain
cook
and
dr
livingstone
and
we
may
reasonably
conclude
that
there
have
been
many
other
and
earlier
travellers
as
scrupulously
truthful
there
have
undoubtedly
been
travellers
who
have
too
credulously
accepted
mere
hearsay
in
place
of
actual
observation
and
these
whether
ancient
medi
val
or
modern
are
responsible
for
the
stigma
that
has
at
times
attached
to
travellers
tales
all
that
we
are
at
present
careful
to
assert
is
that
the
great
bulk
of
travellers
and
authors
in
the
middle
ages
as
in
all
other
ages
were
neither
the
fools
nor
the
knaves
that
the
malicious
or
the
hypercritical
would
sometimes
fain
represent
them
we
speedily
find
on
opening
any
of
the
books
on
natural
history
that
were
issued
in
the
middle
ages
that
such
ancient
writers
as
pliny
aristotle
or
herodotus
and
other
venerable
authorities
are
held
in
great
reverence
and
that
the
prefatory
as
pliny
saith
gives
at
once
dignity
and
authenticity
to
any
statement
advanced
medi
val
zoology
is
no
more
independent
of
the
gatherings
of
previous
centuries
than
the
dogmas
of
nineteenth
century
christianity
are
independent
of
the
writings
of
isaiah
in
comparing
ancient
or
medi
val
zoology
with
modern
we
are
conscious
of
a
difference
of
aim
and
treatment
the
study
of
the
present
day
is
largely
devoted
to
the
life
history
of
the
creatures
themselves
their
structure
and
so
forth
while
in
former
times
the
writer
strove
ordinarily
after
an
entirely
different
aim
thinking
much
less
of
these
external
facts
but
dwelling
upon
the
value
of
the
animal
to
mankind
in
one
of
two
directions
while
we
occasionally
in
books
of
travels
have
the
more
modern
and
descriptive
treatment
the
main
bulk
of
the
writings
on
animals
in
medi
val
days
had
ordinarily
one
of
two
objects
the
healing
of
the
body
or
the
saving
of
the
soul
hence
the
medical
writers
sought
anxiously
for
the
vertues
that
indicated
their
value
to
suffering
humanity
and
the
theologians
sought
with
equal
zeal
to
implant
a
moral
and
if
the
facts
in
this
latter
case
did
not
lend
themselves
very
happily
to
this
treatment
so
much
the
worse
for
the
facts
as
an
illustration
of
this
moral
pointing
treatment
we
find
in
one
of
these
old
writers
that
polypus
is
a
fish
with
many
feet
and
a
rounde
head
neare
unto
them
it
is
a
great
enemy
to
the
lobster
and
they
can
often
change
their
colour
and
by
that
project
devoure
other
fishes
their
use
and
custom
is
to
be
lurking
closely
by
the
sides
and
roots
of
rocks
changing
themselves
into
the
colour
of
the
same
thing
unto
which
they
cleave
insomuch
that
they
seem
as
a
part
of
the
rock
whither
when
the
foolish
fish
swim
they
fall
into
danger
for
whilst
they
dread
nothing
these
polypodes
suddenly
prey
upon
them
and
devoure
them
and
indeede
this
is
the
constancie
and
unfeared
treacherie
which
is
often
found
in
many
men
who
will
be
anything
for
their
own
ends
and
nothing
without
them
sparing
none
for
their
own
purposes
nor
loving
any
but
to
effect
them
their
heads
indeed
may
well
be
neare
their
feet
for
they
prize
the
trash
we
trample
on
farre
above
the
joyes
of
heaven
else
they
would
never
work
their
fond
purposes
by
deceitfull
meanes
and
damage
others
to
help
themselves
another
illustration
of
the
same
kind
states
that
although
the
mole
be
blinde
all
her
lifetime
yet
she
beginneth
to
open
her
eyes
in
dying
whiche
is
a
prettie
embleme
this
serveth
to
decypher
the
state
of
a
worldly
man
who
neither
seeth
heaven
nor
thinketh
of
hell
in
his
lifetime
untill
he
be
dying
and
then
beginning
to
feel
that
which
before
he
either
not
believed
or
not
regarded
he
looketh
up
and
seeth
for
even
against
his
will
he
is
then
compelled
to
open
his
eyes
and
acknowledge
his
sinnes
although
before
he
could
not
see
them
we
have
taken
these
two
passages
from
the
speculum
mundi
or
a
glasse
representing
the
face
of
the
world
whereunto
is
added
a
discourse
of
the
creation
together
with
a
consideration
of
such
things
as
are
pertinent
to
each
dayes
worke
it
was
written
by
one
john
swan
and
the
copy
before
us
as
we
write
bears
date
it
is
a
good
typical
example
of
the
theological
treatment
of
natural
history
that
was
long
so
much
in
vogue
many
parables
and
fables
in
like
manner
deal
with
animals
as
so
much
raw
material
to
be
shaped
to
such
moral
end
as
the
narrator
or
writer
pleases
the
idea
that
it
was
permissible
to
sacrifice
a
lower
truth
to
gain
a
higher
one
and
to
make
whatever
modification
was
needed
to
turn
a
good
moral
into
one
still
better
was
very
frankly
held
as
the
goodness
of
the
intention
was
considered
ample
justification
for
any
aberration
from
the
actual
facts
thus
hippeau
writes

this
simple
principle
runs
through
the
whole
series
of
bestiaries
published
under
ecclesiastical
influence
and
while
it
gives
them
a
special
interest
of
their
own
deprives
them
of
any
scientific
value
the
zoological
lore
of
the
medi
val
writers
was
based
to
some
degree
upon
actual
observation
but
was
still
more
often
largely
borrowed
from
earlier
writers
and
was
greatly
influenced
by
various
external
influences
such
as
astrology
it
was
moreover
a
very
credulous
age
and
men
in
all
good
faith
wrote
or
read
statements
of
wild
improbability
or
of
absolute
impossibility
statements
too
that
could
so
readily
be
brought
to
the
test
of
experiment
that
one
would
have
thought
it
impossible
to
gain
a
week
s
credence
for
them
and
yet
which
are
gravely
transferred
from
one
book
to
another
for
centuries
numerous
examples
of
such
statements
will
necessarily
crop
up
throughout
our
pages
but
we
may
by
way
of
immediate
illustration
quote
a
couple
these
are
both
taken
from
a
work
entitled
alberti
parvi
lucii
libellus
de
mirabilibus
natur
arcanis
which
was
once
very
popular
was
translated
into
french
and
english
and
held
in
high
repute
we
merely
quote
these
instances
as
we
find
them
in
the
first
book
that
comes
to
our
hand
it
would
be
easy
from
a
score
of
other
books
to
give
a
hundred
of
like
character
the
first
of
these
would
be
invaluable
to
athletes
if
only
it
would
bear
the
test
of
experience
gather
some
of
the
herb
called
motherwort
when
the
sun
is
entering
the
first
degree
of
the
sign
of
capricorn
let
it
dry
a
little
in
the
shade
and
make
some
garters
of
the
skin
of
a
young
hare
that
is
to
say
having
cut
the
skin
of
the
hare
into
strips
two
inches
wide
double
them
sew
the
before
mentioned
herb
between
and
wear
them
on
your
legs
no
horse
can
long
keep
up
with
a
man
on
foot
who
is
furnished
with
those
garters
there
is
evidently
here
an
idea
that
the
speed
of
the
hare
can
be
somehow
bestowed
on
the
man
who
wears
its
skin
and
this
notion
of
transfer
crops
up
repeatedly
in
these
old
recipes
our
next
extract
points
to
a
time
of
some
little
peril
and
gives
welcome
means
of
avoiding
the
evils
that
might
befall
the
traveller
gather
on
the
morrow
of
all
saints
a
strong
branch
of
willow
of
which
you
will
make
a
staff
fashioned
to
your
liking
hollow
it
out
by
removing
the
pith
from
within
after
having
furnished
the
lower
end
with
an
iron
ferrule
put
into
the
bottom
of
the
staff
the
two
eyes
of
a
young
wolf
the
tongue
and
heart
of
a
dog
three
green
lizards
and
the
hearts
of
two
young
swallows
these
must
all
be
dried
in
the
sun
between
two
papers
having
been
first
sprinkled
with
finely
ground
saltpetre
besides
all
these
put
into
the
staff
seven
leaves
of
vervain
gathered
on
the
eve
of
st
john
the
baptist
with
a
stone
of
divers
colours
which
you
will
find
in
the
nest
of
the
lapwing
and
stop
the
end
of
the
staff
with
a
panel
of
box
or
of
any
other
material
you
please
and
be
assured
that
this
staff
will
preserve
you
from
the
perils
which
befall
the
traveller
either
from
robbers
wild
beasts
mad
dogs
or
venomous
animals
it
will
also
procure
you
the
goodwill
of
those
with
whom
you
lodge
the
dread
of
mad
dogs
of
scorpions
and
other
venomous
creatures
seems
to
have
been
extreme
in
the
middle
ages
every
medical
book
and
herbal
abounding
in
preservatives
from
and
antidotes
for
such
perils
to
the
traveller
it
will
be
noted
in
these
and
such
like
receipts
that
no
little
amount
of
trouble
was
necessarily
entailed
in
providing
the
necessary
ingredients
and
in
providing
them
at
the
special
season
that
increased
their
efficacy
the
necessary
items
in
the
foregoing
receipt
a
calendar
to
tell
when
the
saints
days
come
round
a
willow
stick
a
wolf
two
swallows
and
a
dog
to
be
slain
lizards
to
be
captured

ferrule
and
plug
of
box
to
be
procured
vervain
leaves
to
be
gathered
and
lapwing
s
nest
to
be
found
and
ransacked
are
really
few
in
number
and
easy
of
attainment
compared
to
those
required
in
many
preparations
in
the
famous
vermifuge
and
antidote
to
all
animal
poisons
that
was
known
as
venice
treacle
there
were
seventy
three
ingredients
this
was
retained
in
the
london
pharmacopeia
up
to
little
more
than
a
century
ago
the
fourteenth
century
equivalent
of
the
well
known
legend
of
the
nineteenth
century
chemist
prescriptions
carefully
prepared
must
have
carried
with
it
a
tremendous
responsibility
in
medi
val
days
another
potent
influence
with
the
older
writers
was
the
delight
in
what
is
abnormal
and
wonderful
and
here
again
a
ready
credulity
found
ample
material
the
love
of
the
marvellous
is
deeply
engraved
in
human
nature
we
may
see
abundant
proof
of
this
in
such
classic
myths
as
the
sirens
in
the
monstrous
forms
carved
or
depicted
in
the
temples
of
egypt
or
mexico
in
the
popularity
of
such
books
as
the
arabian
nights
tales
or
the
adventures
of
gulliver
or
munchausen
down
to
the
fearful
joy
of
the
youngsters
in
the
nursery
in
the
sanguinary
giant
whose
food
was
the
blood
of
englishmen
far
away
in
the
twilight
time
of
every
people
in
every
clime
dragons
and
griffins
and
monsters

and
other
wonders
that
still
turn
up
from
time
to
time
during
the
dull
season
in
the
newspapers
are
but
a
few
examples
that
at
once
occur
to
one
s
thoughts
ovid
and
pliny
in
their
day
went
to
very
considerable
lengths
to
satisfy
this
love
of
the
marvellous
in
the
middle
ages
writers
not
a
few
discoursed
of
dog
headed
men
of
pigmies
of
the
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
while
no
country
fair
in
this
present
year
of
grace
would
be
considered
by
its
patrons
at
all
up
to
date
unless
it
included
a
giant
and
a
dwarf
together
with
a
two
headed
calf
or
some
such
monstrosity
the
writings
of
chaucer
shakespeare
and
other
poets
abound
in
allusions
to
the
folk
lore
of
the
time
thus
in
the
lines
when
beggars
die
there
are
no
comets
seen
the
heavens
themselves
blaze
forth
the
death
of
princes
we
have
an
interesting
reference
to
the
old
belief
that
all
things
terrestrial
or
celestial
were
created
for
the
service
of
man
and
were
profitable
in
some
way
or
other
to
him
much
of
the
early
medical
treatment
was
a
strange
mixture
of
astrological
zoological
and
botanical
lore
thus
chaucer
tells
us
of
his
doctour
of
phisik
that
in
al
this
world
ne
was
ther
non
him
lyk
to
speke
of
phisik
and
of
surgerye
for
he
was
grounded
in
astronomye
not
only
did
he
put
his
trust
in
drugges
and
letuaries
but
he
kepte
his
pacient
wonderfully
wel
in
houres
by
his
magik
naturel
wel
coude
be
fortunen
the
ascendent
of
his
ymages
for
his
pacient
we
have
seen
that
it
was
a
necessary
condition
in
the
preparation
of
the
receipt
that
we
have
given
that
the
sun
should
be
in
a
particular
position
in
the
heavens
prior
to
gathering
one
of
the
ingredients
and
the
saturnine
jovial
martial
or
mercurial
qualities
of
various
substances
employed
in
the
healing
art
owed
their
potency
to
a
due
regard
to
the
starry
influences
in
a
quaint
old
book
imprinted
in
london
at
flete
streate
nyghe
unto
saint
dunstones
churche
by
one
thomas
marshe
and
published
by
him
in
the
year
we
have
goodlye
doctrine
and
instruction
necessarye
to
be
marked
and
folowed
of
all
true
chirurgeons
gathered
and
diligently
set
forth
by
john

the
title
of
an

expostulation
against

both
of

in

he
sums
up
the

of

properly
equipped

shall
make

one
interesting
result
of
searching
in
these
old
tomes
is
that
amidst
much
that
the
world
has
now
outlived
one
often
finds
interesting
references
that
show
how
unchanging
some
customs
are
and
how
some
of
the
things
that
we
have
regarded
as
recent
discoveries
were
after
all
well
known
centuries
ago
it
is
somewhat
startling
for
instance
to
see
the
great
african
lakes
the
victoria
and
albert
nyanza
and
others
that
have
only
comparatively
lately
been
rediscovered
quite
clearly
marked
in
some
ancient
maps
and
the
whole
course
of
the
nile
from
source
to
sea
as
definitely
given
as
that
of
thames
or
tiber
we
speak
of
the
unchanging
east
and
adopt
the
phrase
with
more
or
less
of
thoughtful
acquiescence
but
it
is
distinctly
interesting
in
the
pages
of
jordanus
for
example
to
find
the
parsee
funeral
customs
and
the
tower
of
silence
thus
referred
to
there
be
pagan
folk
in
this
india
who
worship
fire
they
bury
not
their
dead
neither
do
they
burn
them
but
cast
them
into
the
midst
of
a
certain
roofless
tower
and
there
expose
them
totally
uncovered
to
the
fowls
of
heaven
he
was
present
also
at
suttee
for
he
says
i
have
sometimes
seen
for
one
dead
man
who
was
burnt
five
living
women
take
their
places
on
the
fire
with
their
dead
and
for
the
love
of
their
husbands
and
for
eternal
life
burn
along
with
them
with
as
much
joy
as
if
they
were
going
to
be
wedded
this
jordanus
was
a
missionary
bishop
in
india
he
was
appointed
to
the
bishopric
of
columbum
by
pope
john
xxii
by
a
bull
bearing
date
april
th
there
are
indications
that
there
was
at
that
time
a
considerable
body
of
christians
at
columbum
but
the
locality
is
now
entirely
unknown
many
conflicting
theories
have
been
held
and
each
one
demolished
as
hopeless
by
the
holders
of
the
others
his
book
entitled
mirabilia
descripta
was
written
in
latin
like
many
other
old
writers
very
justly
observes
colonel
henry
yule
who
published
an
english
translation
of
his
book
from
which
we
quote
whilst
endeavouring
to
speak
only
truth
of
what
he
had
seen
jordanus
retails
fables
enough
from
hearsay
what
he
did
see
in
his
travels
was
so
marvellous
to
him
that
he
was
quite
ready
to
accept
what
was
told
him
of
regions
more
remote
from
christendom
when
it
seemed
but
in
reasonable
proportion
more
marvellous
of
the
truth
of
this
we
shall
doubtless
find
illustration
in
subsequent
references
to
his
book
maundevile
in
like
manner
in
his
voiage
and
travaile
gives
us
another
insight
into
the
unchangeable
nature
of
the
customs
of
the
east
we
recognize
at
once
the
sacrifice
made
to
juggernaut
when
we
read
that

the

mention
of
it
very
advantageously
introduce
some
few
details
respecting
it
the
voiage
and
travaile
of
sir
john
maundevile
was
professedly
a
book
for
the
guidance
of
pilgrims
and
travellers
journeying
to
jerusalem
but
on
the
same
principle
that
it
has
been
asserted
that
all
roads
lead
to
rome
so
all
seemed
to
have
centred
in
the
capital
of
jud
a
hence
his
book
is
comprehensive
enough
to
include
the
marvayles
of
inde
and
a
very
full
description
of
china
the
book
was
one
of
the
most
popular
works
of
the
middle
ages
and
passed
through
many
editions
both
in
england
and
on
the
continent
first
in
manuscript
form
and
afterwards
as
a
printed
book
of
no
book
with
the
exception
of
the
scriptures
can
more
mss
be
found
of
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
and
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
nineteen
manuscript
copies
of
it
four
being
in
latin
and
nine
in
french
are
in
the
library
of
the
british
museum
and
others
at
oxford
cambridge
and
in
various
other
libraries
in
one
of
the
copies
in
the
british
museum
a
small
vellum
folio
of
the
fourteenth
century
its
raison
d
tre
is
thus
defined
here
bygynneth
the
book
of
john
maundevile
knyght
of
inglelond
that
was
y
bore
in
the
toun
of
seynt
albons
and
travelide
aboute
in
the
worlde
in
manye
diverse
countreis
to
se
mervailes
and
customes
of
countreis
and
diversiteis
of
folkys
and
diverse
shap
of
men
and
of
beistis
and
all
the
mervaill
that
he
say
he
wrot
and
tellitte
in
this
book
the
book
is
made
up
from
his
personal
experiences
supplemented
by
gossip
and
hearsay
while
at
times
he
appropriated
freely
from
the
works
of
other
authors
much
of
what
he
tells
of
china
and
india
is
markedly
similar
for
instance
to
the
narrative
of
friar
odoric
the
narration
of
whose
travels
in
those
lands
was
given
to
the
world
in
the
year
when
maundevile
has
an
exceptionally
improbable
story
to
narrate
he
evades
personal
responsibility
by
prefacing
it
with
the
formula
thei
seyn
he
set
out
on
his
travels
on
michaelmas
day
in
and
was
absent
from
england
for
thirty
four
years
being
ravished
with
a
mightie
desire
to
see
the
greater
part
of
the
world
and
in
that
lengthened
period
of
absence
going
far
towards
the
attainment
of
his
ideal
as
regards
the
mention
by
various
old
authors
of
divers
things
that
we
have
a
way
of
considering
quite
recent
discoveries
we
may
give
as
an
illustration
the
coca
plant
this
has
been
within
the
last
few
years
brought
to
the
front
and
highly
commended
as
a
stimulant
from
its
undoubted
power
of
enabling
one
to
sustain
strength
and
endurance
during
any
exceptional
bodily
exertion
but
on
taking
down
burton
s
miracles
of
art
and
nature
from
our
bookshelf
we
find
that
over
two
hundred
years
ago
our
copy
is
dated
all
this
was
as
thoroughly
known
as
it
is
to
day
after
mentioning
in
his
description
of
peru
divers
curious
animals
he
goes
on
to
say
some
as
deservedly
account
the
coca
for
a
wonder
the
leaves
whereof
being
dried
and
formed
into
lozenges
or
little
pellets
are
exceedingly
useful
in
a
journey
for
melting
in
the
mouth
they
satisfie
both
hunger
and
thirst
and
preserve
a
man
in
his
strength
and
his
spirits
in
vigour
and
are
generally
esteemed
of
such
soveraign
use
that
it
is
thought
no
less
than
baskets
full
of
the
leaves
of
this
tree
are
sold
yearly
at
the
mines
of
potosi
only
each
of
which
at
some
other
places
would
yield
d
or
d
apiece
burton
s
book
miracles
of
art
and
nature
or
a
brief
description
of
the
several
varieties
of
birds
beasts
fishes
plants
and
fruits
of
other
countreys
together
with
severall
remarkable
things
in
the
world
contains
much
curious
and
interesting
matter
and
we
shall
find
occasion
to
quote
from
it
from
time
to
time
in
our
subsequent
pages
the
scope
and
aim
of
the
book
may
be
very
well
gathered
from
the
following
extract
from
the
preface
candid
reader
what
thou
findest
herein
are
collections
out
of
severall
antient
authors
which
with
no
small
trouble
i
have
carefully
and
diligently
collected
and
comprised
into
this
small
book
at
some
vacant
hours
for
the
divertisement
of
such
as
thyself
who
are
disposed
to
read
it
for
the
several
climates
of
the
world
have
not
only
influenced
the
inhabitants
but
the
very
beasts
with
natures
different
from
one
another
so
hast
thou
here
not
only
a
description
of
the
several
shapes
and
natures
of
variety
of
birds
beasts
fishes
plants
and
fruits
but
also
of
the
dispositions
and
customs
though
some
of
them
barbarous
and
inhuman
of
severall
people
who
inhabit
many
pleasing
and
other
parts
of
the
world
i
think
there
is
not
a
chapter
wherein
thou
wilt
not
find
various
and
remarkable
things
worth
thy
observation
and
such
take
the
book
throughout
that
thou
canst
not
have
in
any
one
author
at
least
modern
and
of
this
volume
tis
probable
they
are
not
so
methodically
dispos
d
as
some
hands
might
have
done
yet
for
variety
and
pleasure
sake
they
are
i
hope
pleasingly
enough
intermixed
and
as
i
find
this
accepted
so
i
shall
proceed
farewel
that
the
disposition
is
not
altogether
methodical
is
speedily
evident
as
opening
the
book
at
random
we
find
chapters
following
each
other
on
norwey
assiria
quivira
in
california
germany
nova

the
influence
of
pliny
is
of
immense
weight
with
the
writers
of
medi
val
days
and
even
when
the
well
used
formula
as
pliny
saith
is
not
given
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
his
labours
will
have
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
utilization
of
his
material
by
his
successors
thus
pliny
tells
us
that
many
wonderful
things
which
he
specifies
are
to
be
found
in
ethiopia
hence
ethiopia
has
been
discovered
by
many
subsequent
writers
to
be
a
marvellous
land
and
the
wondrous
things
they
detail
of
it
have
strange
similarity
with
those
of
the
older
writer
this
need
not
in
all
cases
imply
plagiarism
if
a
writer
five
hundred
years
ago
in
describing
the
bay
of
naples
introduced
a
volcano
into
his
description
we
do
not
resent
all
subsequent
writers
on
the
subject
also
seeing
it
but
when
an
ancient
writer
introduces
a
rank
impossibility
and
subsequent
writers
see
that
too
we
may
reasonably
assume
that
they
have
been
borrowing
as
an
illustration
we
may
mention
that
we
read
in
the
pages
of
pliny
of
single
footed
men
who
possess
this
solitary
feature
of
so
gigantic
a
size
that
its
owner
utilizes
it
as
a
sunshade
hence
these
people
appear
from
time
to
time
in
the
pages
of
divers
travellers
maundevile
for
instance
without
acknowledgment
of
the
source
of
his
information
which
he
allows
us
to
think
is
the
result
of
his
personal
observation
tells
us
that
in
ethiope
ben
many
dyverse
folk
and
goes
on
to
specify
that
in
that
contree
ben
folk
that
have
but
on
foot
and
thei
gon
so
fast
that
it
is
marvayle
and
the
foot
is
so
large
that
it
schademethe
all
the
body
agen
the
sonne
whanne
thei
wole
lye
and
reste
hem
that
pliny
was
at
times
imposed
upon
by
his
informants
is
sufficiently
obvious
from
the
illustration
that
we
have
given
but
when
all
deductions
have
been
made
his
work
was
a
very
wonderful
and
valuable
one
and
a
monument
of
painstaking
industry
intellectual
power
and
enormous
erudition
the
great
naturalist
cuvier
no
mean
authority
calls
it
one
of
the
most
precious
monuments
that
have
come
down
to
us
from
ancient
times
buffon
no
mean
authority
either
writes
it
is
so
to
say
a
compilation
from
all
that
had
been
written
before
his
time
a
record
of
all
that
was
excellent
or
useful
but
his
record
has
in
it
features
so
grand
this
compilation
contains
matter
grouped
in
a
manner
so
novel
that
it
is
preferable
to
most
of
the
original
works
that
treat
upon
similar
subjects
seeing
that
it
is
the
fons
et
origo
of
so
much
subsequent
work
we
may
well
devote
some
little
space
to
its
consideration
for
medi
val
natural
history
is
largely
pliny
either
frankly
acknowledged
boldly
appropriated
without
acknowledgment
or
at
least
the
nucleus
around
which
other
observations
of
more
or
less
value
are
gathered
pliny
s
book
is
of
the
most
comprehensive
character
and
even
his
table
of
contents
runs
into
many
pages
this
table
would
appear
at
the
time
of
its
issue
to
have
been
almost
a
literary
curiosity
as
he
prefaces
it
by
saying
that
as
you
should
be
spared
as
far
as
possible
from
all
trouble
i
have
subjoined
the
contents
of
the
following
books
and
have
used
my
best
endeavours
to
prevent
your
being
obliged
to
read
them
all
through
and
this
which
was
done
for
your
benefit
will
also
serve
the
same
purpose
for
others
so
that
anyone
may
search
for
what
he
wishes
and
may
know
where
to
find
it
this
has
been
done
before
amongst
us
by
valerius
soranus
in
his
book
which
he
entitled
on
mysteries
the
following
shortened
list
gives
a
notion
of
the
general
character
of
the
various
sections
of
this
magnum
opus
after
the
first
book
which
is
occupied
entirely
by
the
elaborate
preface
to
the
emperor
the
author
plunges
at
once
into
his
subject
and
devotes
the
second
book
to
a
general
treatise
on
the
elements
and
on
the
world
and
the
heavenly
bodies
the
third
and
fourth
books
describe
the
great
bays
of
europe
while
the
fifth
and
sixth
deal
with
africa
and
asia
respectively
the
seventh
book
is
entirely
devoted
to
man
and
the
eighth
and
ninth
are
on
land
and
aquatic
animals
the
tenth
treats
of
birds
and
the
eleventh
of
insects
the
attention
of
the
author
and
reader
is
then
turned
to
matters
botanical
and
the
twelfth
book
dwells
upon
odoriferous
plants
the
thirteenth
is
occupied
with
the
consideration
of
the
various
exotic
trees
then
known
while
the
fourteenth
is
devoted
entirely
to
the
vine
and
the
fifteenth
to
fruit
trees
generally
in
the
next
book
the
sixteenth
the
author
passes
to
a
consideration
of
the
various
kinds
of
forest
trees
and
in
the
following
the
seventeenth
to
the
plants
raised
in
nurseries
and
gardens
the
eighteenth
book
deals
with
the
cultivation
of
corn
and
the
general
pursuits
of
the
husbandman
the
treatise
then
turns
to
economic
and
medicinal
considerations
section
nineteen
taking
up
flax
and
other
commercial
plants
and
twenty
dealing
with
the
herbs
cultivated
for
food
or
medicine
the
twenty
first
and
twenty
second
are
somewhat
sthetic
and
dwell
upon
the
flowers
and
plants
proper
for
garlands
the
twenty
third
and
twenty
fourth
and
twenty
fifth
are
devoted
to
the
medicines
made
from
cultivated
trees
forest
trees
and
wild
plants
respectively
the
twenty
sixth
deals
with
new
diseases
and
their
appropriate
treatment
by
herbs
and
the
twenty
seventh
is
a
continuation
and
amplification
of
the
twentieth
the
twenty
eighth
and
twenty
ninth
are
devoted
to
the
medicines
derived
from
animals
and
the
thirtieth
chapter
deals
with
magic
and
the
proper
medicines
for
various
parts
of
the
body
the
thirty
first
and
thirty
second
sections
are
given
up
to
the
economic
uses
of
various
aquatic
animals
one
being
entirely
devoted
to
their
medicinal
value
and
the
next
to
their
general
commercial
adaptability
the
remaining
chapters
deal
with
the
mineral
kingdom
the
thirty
third
chapter
being
given
up
wholly
to
gold
and
silver
and
the
thirty
fourth
to
lead
and
copper
the
thirty
fifth
division
is
given
up
to
pictures
and
colours
and
the
painters
and
users
thereof
the
thirty
sixth
chapter
is
occupied
with
marbles
and
various
kinds
of
stone
while
the
concluding
section
deals
with
gems
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
the
work
is
of
the
most
comprehensive
character
and
however
far
the
world
may
since
have
travelled
and
in
its
revolutions
disproved
much
that
when
this
book
was
written
was
held
to
be
undoubted
the
book
nevertheless
remains
a
noble
monument
of
the
zeal
energy
and
thirst
after
knowledge
of
its
author
caius
plinius
secundus
ordinarily
called
the
elder
to
distinguish
him
from
his
nephew
who
was
also
an
eminent
man
of
letters
was
born
at
verona
or
como
a
d
as
the
son
of
a
roman
of
noble
family
he
was
early
devoted
to
a
military
career
and
spent
a
considerable
portion
of
his
life
in
the
army
where
he
gained
distinction
in
various
campaigns
and
on
his
retirement
from
actual
service
was
appointed
by
the
emperor
procurator
of
spain
though
much
occupied
in
public
work
he
was
an
enthusiastic
student
and
devoted
all
his
intervals
of
relaxation
to
literature
during
dinner
he
was
either
being
read
to
or
was
busily
engaged
in
taking
notes
and
when
travelling
his
secretary
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
him
even
while
enjoying
his
bath
he
was
busy
dictating
or
imbibing
knowledge
he
was
a
tremendous
worker
and
besides
the
natural
history
wrote
a
voluminous
treatise
on
the
german
campaign
and
various
other
books
he
fell
a
victim
to
his
love
of
science
as
while
commanding
the
fleet
he
was
witness
of
the
great
eruption
of
vesuvius
that
destroyed
pompeii
and
herculaneum
and
while
making
observations
ashore
he
was
overwhelmed
in
thick
sulphurous
vapour
pliny
had
an
intense
love
of
nature
and
to
his
own
researches
he
added
those
of
a
great
body
of
other
observers
sifting
with
infinite
patience
from
their
labours
whatever
he
deemed
of
value
and
accumulating
vast
stores
of
observation
that
he
at
times
drew
false
conclusions
is
sufficiently
evident
but
it
is
clearly
not
just
to
apply
a
nineteenth
century
standard
to
his
labours
he
gave
credence
to
many
stories
that
have
since
been
proved
erroneous
but
he
always
honestly
strove
after
truth
when
he
tells
us
for
example
that
the
appearance
of
an
owl
is
a
portent
of
misfortune
he
adds
but
i
myself
know
that
it
hath
perched
upon
many
houses
of
private
men
and
yet
hath
no
evil
followed
at
the
beginning
of
each
book
pliny
is
careful
to
give
the
names
of
the
authors
that
he
has
consulted
for
it
as
the
subjects
that
he
treats
of
are
very
varied
the
total
list
of
authorities
is
very
large
some
of
the
names
such
as
virgil
archimedes
and
others
are
those
of
men
still
held
in
reverence
while
many
are
naturally
now
but
little
known
their
works
having
perished
as
an
illustration
of
the
thoroughness
of
pliny
in
the
matter
we
will
give
an
illustrative
list
that
which
precedes
his
eighth
book
dealing
with
land
animals
he
divides
his
lists
always
into
two
sections
and
commences
with
the
authors
of
his
own
country
these
in
this
particular
instance
are
mutianus
procilius
verrius
flaccus
l
piso
cornelius
valerianus
cato
the
censor
fenestella
trogus
actius
columella
virgil
varro
metellus
scipio
cornelius
celsus
nigidius
trebius
niger
pomponius
mela
and
manlius
sura
his
foreign
authorities
are
considerably
more
numerous
and
are
naturally
most
of
them
greek
writers
polybius
onesicritus
isidorus
antipater
aristotle
demetrius
democritus
theophrastus
euanthes
hiero
duris
ctesias
philistus
architas
philarchus
amphilochus
the
athenian
anaxipolis
the
thasian
apollodorus
of
lemnos
aristophanes
the
milesian
antigonus
the
cym
an
and
twenty
three
others
whom
it
is
needless
to
add
to
the
list
as
it
is
already
quite
long
enough
to
illustrate
the
care
with
which
pliny
fortified
his
own
knowledge
with
the
best
aid
that
he
could
procure
though
doubtless
in
some
cases
the
bearers
of
these
names
were
travellers
and
others
who
contributed
but
one
or
two
items
to
the
store
of
knowledge
the
greater
portion
of
the
names
are
those
of
men
who
to
the
best
of
their
ability
were
endeavouring
to
penetrate
the
secrets
of
nature
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
at
this
early
period
there
should
be
such
a
body
of
scientific
opinion
to
draw
upon
pliny
tells
us
that
he
has
dealt
with
twenty
thousand
subjects
and
that
this
has
necessitated
the
perusal
of
over
two
thousand
books
though
the
quaintness
of
some
of
the
ideas
we
encounter
in
pliny
raises
a
smile
yet
the
real
wonder
is
that
he
was
able
to
produce
a
book
so
excellent
and
the
more
one
reads
of
it
the
more
this
truth
is
impressed
upon
one
s
mind
in
many
of
his
ideas
he
appears
to
have
been
far
in
advance
of
his
age
thus
he
distinctly
declares
that
the
world
is
round
and
gives
lucid
reasons
for
his
statement
and
in
an
age
of
abounding
polytheism
when
temples
innumerable
each
enshrined
the
image
of
some
deity
he
had
the
courage
to
declare
that
to
seek
after
any
shape
of
god
and
to
assign
a
form
or
image
to
him
is
a
proof
of
man
s
folly
for
god
wheresoever
he
be
and
in
what
part
soever
resident
all
sense
he
is
all
sight
all
hearing
he
is
the
whole
of
the
life
and
of
the
soul
and
to
believe
that
there
be
gods
innumerable
and
those
according
to
man
s
virtues
as
chastity
concord
understanding
hope
honour
clemency
faith
these
conceits
render
men
s
negligence
the
greater
the
unchanging
nature
of
the
east
that
we
have
already
seen
illustrated
by
extracts
from
medi
val
writers
is
even
visible
in
the
work
of
this
author
of
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
for
pliny
mentions
the
people
called
seres
beyond
scythia
who
fly
the
company
of
other
people
and
who
are
famous
for
the
fine
silk
that
their
woods
yield
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
but
that
these
exclusive
folk
were
the
chinese
he
tells
us
that
they
collect
this
silk
from
the
leaves
of
the
trees
and
having
steeped
it
in
water
card
it
it
being
a
very
pardonable
error
to
conclude
that
this
silk
was
the
product
of
the
tree
itself
rather
than
of
the
silkworm
that
spun
its
cocoon
amongst
its
foliage
the
men
have
feet
of
natural
size
while
the
women
s
are
so
small
that
pliny
s
informant
described
them
as
ostrich
footed
here
we
can
scarcely
doubt
that
the
strange
custom
of
the
chinese
in
binding
up
the
feet
of
the
women
is
referred
to
and
granting
this
it
is
an
interesting
proof
of
the
great
antiquity
of
this
barbarous
proceeding
in
india
too
it
was
reported
to
pliny
that
there
were
certain
philosophers
who
from
sunrise
to
sunset
persevere
in
gazing
upon
the
sun
without
once
removing
their
eyes
and
from
morn
to
eve
stand
upon
one
leg
on
the
burning
sand
it
is
remarkable
to
observe
how
exactly
these
austerities
and
others
of
like
severity
and
uselessness
are
still
practised
by
the
fakirs
of
india
he
tells
us
too
of
others
who
had
strange
influence
over
venomous
serpents
doubtless
the
snake
charmers
whose
descendants
still
exhibit
their
skill
and
refers
to
the
people
of
india
hunting
and
taming
the
elephants
and
using
them
as
beasts
of
burden
as
valuable
aids
to
locomotion
and
for
purposes
of
war
pliny
s
book
has
gone
through
many
editions
and
translations
of
these
we
need
but
mention
that
of
dalecamp
in
de
laet
in
gronovius
pinet
and
poinsinet
de
sivri
an
english
version
of
delightful
quaintness
of
language
and
expression
is
the
translation
issued
by
dr
philemon
holland
in
the
year
he
is
the
only
writer
who
has
given
a
complete
rendering
of
pliny
s
book
in
english
bostock
also
in
began
a
translation
and
issued
the
first
and
thirty
third
books
as
a
specimen
of
a
proposed
rendering
of
the
whole
work
his
death
prevented
the
accomplishment
of
the
task
the
reader
in
subsequent
passages
will
readily
detect
for
himself
from
which
source
any
quotation
we
give
is
derived
as
the
diction
of
holland
is
far
more
quaint
and
old
fashioned
than
that
of
the
later
translator
several
other
writers
of
antiquity
influenced
the
medi
val
authors
but
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
detail
their
labours
at
any
length
since
if
they
lived
before
pliny
he
borrowed
from
them
and
if
they
lived
afterwards
they
borrowed
from
him
so
that
we
practically
in
pliny
get
the
pith
and
cream
of
all
herodotus
the
historiarum
parens
as
cicero
terms
him
was
we
read
scarcely
a
historian
but
one
finds
divers
passages
from
time
to
time
in
his
descriptions
of
egypt
and
other
lands
that
throw
an
interesting
side
light
on
the
natural
history
of
the
country
under
consideration
and
these
have
a
certain
value
a
writer
of
greater
direct
importance
is
aristotle
one
of
the
most
illustrious
naturalists
of
antiquity
it
will
be
remembered
that
his
works
supplanted
the
love
of
gold
of
sumptuous
apparel
even
the
charms
of
music
in
the
breast
of
chaucer
s
philosopher
and
formed
an
all
sufficient
solace
for
a
light
cash
box
a
sparse
wardrobe
and
the
missing
fidel
the
passage
is
interesting
as
it
indicates
the
repute
in
which
the
works
of
the
ancient
writer
were
held
in
the
days
of
the
poet
for
him
was

but
all
be
that
he
was

yet
hadde
he

aristotle
had
very
exceptional
opportunities
of
acquiring
knowledge
as
his
royal
patron
and
friend
the
potent
alexander
the
great
was
able
and
willing
to
afford
him
aid
that
was
invaluable
to
him
thousands
of
men
huntsmen
fishermen
soldiers
in
distant
garrisons
of
his
far
stretching
realm
by
royal
command
were
instructed
to
keep
a
keen
outlook
and
to
forward
to
aristotle
anything
that
was
curious
or
rare
or
to
procure
him
if
possible
any
specimen
he
desired
to
possess
his
book
de
animalibus
though
naturally
not
free
from
a
certain
amount
of
error
and
the
intrusion
of
second
hand
hearsay
is
a
mine
of
industry
and
research
and
not
unworthy
of
the
special
opportunities
that
gave
it
birth
in
the
study
of
our
subject
during
the
middle
ages
several
sources
of
information
are
open
to
us
of
hooks
on
natural
history
pure
and
simple
there
are
none
their
day
was
not
yet
the
love
of
nature
for
its
own
sake
was
a
later
birth
but
the
books
of
travels
often
detail
the
zoology
and
botany
of
the
lands
journeyed
through
then
there
are
the
medical
books
containing
the
most
extraordinary
remedies
or
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
to
say
prescriptions
for
the
ills
of
suffering
humanity
and
which
more
or
less
fully
describe
the
source
and
origin
of
the
various
ingredients
in
their
gruesome
pharmacop
ia
and
with
these
we
may
class
the
books
on
social
economics
dealing
with
gastronomy
gardening
the
distillation
of
essences
and
so
forth
and
which
necessarily
deal
in
some
degree
with
the
life
history
of
the
materials
that
are
introduced
in
addition
to
these
we
have
what
are
termed
bestiaries
books
that
treat
the
animals
and
plants
as
so
many
lay
figures
to
be
clothed
upon
with
any
moral
that
with
often
scant
regard
to
facts
will
serve
to
enforce
a
dogma
to
these
must
be
added
the
armories
or
books
on
heraldry
where
the
lions
elephants
bears
and
other
devices
of
blazonry
are
often
very
quaintly
and
graphically
described
for
the
benefit
of
those
doubtless
a
considerable
majority
to
whom
they
were
little
more
than
a
name
or
to
whom
if
they
had
seen
them
at
the
tower
of
london
in
the
royal
collection
further
information
on
creatures
so
strange
was
of
great
interest
in
addition
to
these
sources
of
instruction
of
more
or
less
value
we
may
fitly
refer
to
the
writings
of
the
poets
since
in
the
pages
of
chaucer
shakespeare
and
the
lesser
lights
of
poesy
are
abundant
allusions
to
the
beliefs
of
the
time
in
this
as
in
other
directions
and
many
of
these
are
of
great
interest
and
value

than

it
must
surely
have
been
of
some
quaint
book
of
travel
that
this
old
english
song
writer
was
thinking
when
he
thus
discoursed
on
the
pleasant
debt
we
owe
to
books
when
in
the
stirring
days
of
frobisher
drake
and
raleigh
men
s
minds
were
expanding
to
all
sorts
of
possibilities
and
they
read
with
avidity
of
the
eldorado
of
the
west
and
of
the
headless
men
or
those
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
such
as
were
in
all
good
faith
held
to
be
fairly
represented
by
our
illustration
fig
from
one
of
these
old
books
the
writers
of
the
day
described
too
the
wondrous
creatures
that
peopled
the
torrid
plains
of
africa
or
india
or
the
lands
of
prester
john
or
far
cathay
where
so
many
things
were
new
and
true
and
wonderful
that
it
seemed
as
if
all
things
were
possible
and
a
mermaid
no
more
an
unreasonable
probability
than
a

of
maundevile
we
have
already
made
mention
it
would
be
manifestly
undesirable
to
dwell
at
the
length
that
the
ample
materials
to
hand
would
permit
we
will
mention
but
one
or
two
other
books
as
samples
of
the
bulk
munster
s
cosmography
is
a
book
that
all
bibliophiles
whose
tastes
incline
in
this
direction
should
see
sebastian
munster
the
learned
author
died
of
the
plague
at
basel
in
the
year
at
the
comparatively
early
age
of
sixty
three
almost
immediately
after
he
had
completed
his
book
the
copy
before
us
we
see
was
published
at
basel
in
the
year
of
his
death
everyone
consulting
such
a
book
should
always
begin
at
the
very
beginning
as
the
old
titles
as
we
have
already
indicated
are
often
full
of
interest
and
beauty
in
the
instance
before
us
the
centre
of
the
page
is
filled
up
with
the
title
given
with
that
elaborate
fulness
that
is
so
characteristic
of
early
books
the
upper
part
of
the
page
is
devoted
to
the
secular
and
spiritual
princes
of
the
roman
empire
the
former
crowned
the
latter
wearing
their
mitres
and
each
having
a
shield
of
arms
amongst
the
secular
princes
we
find
those
of
cyprus
ungar
sicilia
bohem
neapol
and
polon
the
sides
of
the
page
are
taken
up
with
panels
containing
the
rulers
of
turkey
tartary
and
such
like
outlandish
places
and
at
the
bottom
is
a
very
comprehensive
picture
indeed
in
the
foreground
resting
against
a
tree
is
a
man
in
grievous
extremity
naked
and
forlorn
and
to
him
advances
a
warlike
savage
with
bow
and
arrow
and
worse
still
a
manifest
inclination
to
use
them
to
the
detriment
of
the
traveller
behind
the
prostrate
figure
is
an
elephant
while
in
rear
of
the
savage
are
three
trees
marked
respectively
piper
muscata
and
gariofili
in
the
background
is
a
river
or
arm
of
the
sea
from
which
dolphins
emerge
and
on
the
further
shore
are
two
towns
and
a
range
of
mountains
the
book
is
very
freely
illustrated
with
maps
portraits
pictures
of
towns
animals
plants
and
so
forth
some
of
the
figures
are
really
very
good
there
is
one
of
the
moufflon
for
instance
that
is
full
of
character
and
truth
while
others
are
hopelessly
wrong
the
same
pictures
come
over
and
over
again
at
intervals
in
the
text
thus
a
man
with
a
great
sword
going
to
chop
off
the
head
of
a
man
kneeling
before
him
stands
for
martyrdom
or
the
doom
of
the
traitor
and
reappears
impartially
on
all
occasions
where
the
text
suggests
such
ideas
the
same
battle
scene
often
crops
up
to
illustrate
the
various
conflicts
described
and
there
is
a
standard
figure
of
a
bishop
with
mitre
and
pastoral
crook
that
serves
as
a
portrait
of
divers
ecclesiastics
the
same
lantern
tower
that
does
duty
for
lucerne
reappears
for
alexandria
it
argues
a
quaint
simplicity
all
round
when
the
author
could
gravely
furnish
and
his
readers
as
gravely
accept
these
few
stock
illustrations
for
all
the
varying
conditions
it
is
very
interesting
to
see
that
in
the
map
of
africa
the
nile
takes
its
rise
from
three
large
lakes
far
south
of
the
equator
but
the
map
of
the
world
is
an
extraordinary
production
and
shows
sources
of
the
nile
notwithstanding
a
strange
ignorance
of
elementary
facts
the
south
atlantic
is
almost
entirely
filled
up
from
brazil
to
africa
by
a
great
sea
monster
in
the
map
of
africa
a
gigantic
elephant
is
introduced
a
proceeding
that
was
rather
popular
with
these
older
writers
and
which
is
satirized
in
the
well
known
lines
of
swift
so
geographers
in
afric
maps
with
savage
pictures
fill
their
gaps
and
o
er
inhabitable
downs
place
elephants
for
want
of
towns
even
in
the
days
of
plutarch
a
kindred
device
was
not
unknown
as
we
find
him
in
the
theseus
writing
as
geographers
crowd
into
the
edges
of
their
maps
parts
of
the
world
which
they
do
not
know
about
adding
notes
in
the
margin
to
the
effect
that
beyond
this
lies
nothing
but
sandy
deserts
full
of
wild
beasts
and
unapproachable
bogs
elsewhere
in
this
map
of
africa
we
see
trees
with
enormous
parrots
miles
long
if
we
judge
them
by
the
general
scale
of
the
map
perched
in
their
branches
and
the
reputed
home
of
the
monoculi
the
one
eyed
men
is
indicated
by
the
introduction
of
one
of
them
in
south
america
in
the
same
way
the
home
of
the
canibali
is
marked
by
a
hut
of
tree
trunks
and
branches
from
which
hang
suspended
as
in
a
larder
a
human
leg
and
a
man
s
head
many
old
beliefs
obtain
curious
illustration
thus
in
one
of
the
quaint
pictures
we
see
a
man
using
the
divining
rod
to
detect
subterranean
water
that
swift
knew
the
book
seems
probable
from
his
happy
allusion
to
the
elephants
in
lieu
of
towns
and
this
probability
grows
almost
into
a
certainty
when
we
read
in
his
tale
of
a
tub
his
assertion
that
sea
men
have
a
custom
when
they
meet
a
whale
of
flinging
him
out
an
empty
tub
by
way
of
amusement
to
divert
him
from
doing
damage
to
the
ship
in
the
cosmography
there
is
the
picture
of
a
ship
to
which
a
whale
is
approaching
somewhat
too
closely
for
the
nerves
of
the
crew
and
they
are
therefore
represented
as
throwing
a
tub
overboard
for
it
to
play
with
neither
the
substitution
of
elephants
for
towns
nor
the
notion
of
the
ship
preserving
tub
are
however
the
exclusive
copyright
of
the
munster
limners
the
former
are
seen
in
various
other
old
maps
and
the
tub
incident
is
introduced
into
the
ship
of
fools
and
other
old
books
the
great
value
of
these
monsters
terrestrial
or
marine
in
filling
up
bare
spaces
and
in
giving
an
additional
interest
and
reality
may
be
very
well
seen
in
the
accompanying
illustration
fig
a
view
of
the
azores
where
the
strange
water
monster
fills
up
very
adequately
indeed
a
space
where
nature
failed
to
deposit
an
island
it
is
impossible
to
decide
its
species
at
first
sight
it
suggests
the
notion
of
a
sawfish
or
water
unicorn
the
old
draughtsman
was
unwilling
that
any
of
it
should
be
lost
to
us
so
instead
of
placing
it
in
the
water
it
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
the
missing
lower
jaw
is
entirely
on
the
surface
the
mysterious
something
that
crosses
it
suggests
the
idea
that
the
creature
is
going
bathing
and
has
thrown
its
towel
schoolboy
fashion
over
its
back
but
on
fuller
reflection
we
take
it
that
that
is
meant
to
indicate
the
wave
and
turmoil
that
the
creature
makes
in
the
otherwise
placid
sea
as
it
rushes
through
it
or
rather
over
it

being
omitted
by
us
it
is
extracted
from
sir
thomas
herbert
s
book
some
yeares
travels
into
africa
and
asia
the
great
especially
the
famous
empires
of
persia
and
industant
the
edition
we
consult
was
printed
in
london
in
the
year
after
the
usual
dedicatory
letter
we
find
the
following
appeal
to
the
reader
here
thou
at
greater
ease
than
he
mayst
behold
what
he
did
see
thou
participat
st
his
gains
but
he
alone
reserves
the
pains
he
travell
d
not
with
lucre
sotted
he
went
for
knowledge
and
he
got
it
then
thank
the
author
thanks
is
light
who
hath
presented
to
thy
sight
seas
lands
men
beasts
fishes
and
birds
the
rarest
that
the
world
affords
personally
we
have
much
pleasure
in
paying
the
suggested
tribute
of
courteous
thanks
and
we
think
that
any
of
our
readers
who
may
encounter
the
book
will
in
like
manner
confess
their
obligations
to
the
old
writer
for
his
labours
we
would
fain
hope
that
the
trip
had
many
brighter
spots
in
it
than
he
seems
quite
willing
to
allow
it
has
been
the
custom
with
many
writers
to
depreciate
the
labours
of
marco
polo
and
to
impute
to
him
a
lack
of
trustworthiness
but
it
appears
to
us
after
a
careful
perusal
of
his
book
that
such
censure
is
scarcely
deserved
he
made
mistakes
but
he
is
poles
asunder
from
such
writers
as
maundevile
or
pinto
his
travels
in
the
east
are
narrated
with
much
fidelity
and
are
almost
entirely
free
from
the
gross
misstatements
that
are
met
with
so
freely
in
many
books
of
travel
not
only
at
this
early
date
but
for
centuries
afterwards
the
original
was
probably
written
in
the
venetian
dialect
but
the
earliest
manuscript
now
known
that
of
is
in
latin
a
copy
of
this
is
in
the
magnificent
library
of
the
british
museum
another
is
in
the
royal
berlin
library
another
in
the
paris
library
and
some
few
others
are
in
private
collections
other
mss
of
it
exist
and
it
was
also
freely
printed
on
the
advent
of
the
printing
press
as
for
instance
at
basle
in
in
venice
in
and
in
brescia
in
paris
nuremberg
strasburg
leipzig
lisbon
seville
london
amsterdam
as
these
various
editions
were
in
the
languages
of
the
respective
places
of
publication
it
indicates
a
widespread
interest
and
it
may
be
taken
as
a
proof
too
that
the
book
was
held
to
possess
solid
value
no
book
of
the
munchausen
type
can
show
such
a
record
as
this
an
excellent
english
edition
very
freely
illustrated
by
notes
is
that
of
william
marsden
published
in
to
this
the
editor
prefixes
a
very
complete
biography
of
the
old
author
master
peter
heylyn
geographer
who
flourished
during
the
reigns
of
charles
i
cromwell
and
charles
ii
tells
us
of
many
marvellous
journeys
in
his
volume
and
introduces
much
that
is
curious
in
his
notes
of
the
natural
history
of
the
countries
visited
india
was
in
those
days
an
inscrutable
and
little
known
land
where
the
wildest
imagination
had
full
play
and
was
in
but
little
danger
of
being
dispossessed
by
cold
reality
wonderful
however
as
the
tales
were
that
came
to
heylyn
s
ears
he
found
some
of
them
almost
beyond
credit
and
after
telling
us
of
men
with
dogges
heads
of
men
with
one
legge
onely
of
such
as
live
by
sent
of
men
that
had
but
one
eye
and
that
in
their
foreheads
and
of
others
whose
eares
did
reach
unto
the
ground
he
is
careful
to
add
but
of
these
relations
and
the
rest
of
this
straine
i
doubt
not
but
the
understanding
reader
knoweth
how
to
judge
and
what
to
believe
he
tells
us
too
of
an
indian
people
that
by
eating
dragon
s
heart
and
liver
attain
to
the
understanding
of
the
languages
of
beasts
who
can
make
themselves
when
they
will
invisible
and
who
have
two
tubbes
whereof
the
one
opened
yields
winde
and
the
other
raine
but
here
too
he
hesitates
to
take
the
responsibility
of
these
tales
and
leaves
their
credence
or
rejection
to
the
faith
or
scepticism
of
his
readers
in
the
moluccas
too
he
hears
of
many
wonders
a
river
for
instance
that
is
plentifully
stored
with
fish
yet
the
water
so
hot
that
it
immediately
scalds
the
skin
off
any
beast
that
is
thrown
into
it
of
men
with
tayles
of
fruit
that
whosoever
eateth
shall
for
the
space
of
twelve
hours
be
out
of
his
wits
of
a
tree
which
all
the
day
time
hath
not
a
floure
on
it
but
within
half
an
hour
after
sunne
set
is
full
of
them
these
however
and
several
other
wonders
of
the
land
he
concludes
by
embracing
in
one
simple
category
all
huge
and
monstrous
lies
he
tells
of
a
people
of
libya
the
psylli
so
venomous
in
themselves
that
they
could
poison
a
snake
one
can
fancy
the
immense
disgust
of
some
poisonous
reptile
of
death
dealing
powers
when
he
found
that
he
had
at
length
met
more
than
his
match
and
that
his
attempt
on
the
life
of
one
of
these
very
objectionable
libyans
was
recoiling
with
fatal
effect
upon
himself
the
america
of
those
days
was
a
very
different
place
from
the
america
of
to
day
primeval
forest
covered
much
of
the
land
the
red
man
and
the
buffalo
were
in
full
possession
and
the
pilgrim
fathers
had
but
lately
landed
on
its
shores
from
the
little
mayflower
as
the
remote
is
always
associated
with
the
wonderful
and
monstrosities
and
marvels
flourish
in
such
congenial
soil
heylyn
finds
in
america
no
less
than
in
asia
and
africa
a
rich
crop
of
marvels
into
these
we
need
not
however
go
those
who
care
to
seek
out
this
old
author
will
find
much
of
quaint
interest
tradition
blending
with
solid
history
and
fable
with
fact
in
his
pages
sir

which
the
spaniards
call

gives
much
curious
information
and
should
not
be
overlooked
we
may
read

divers
curious

to
this
list
we
need
only
add
the
natvrall

of
the

by
joseph
acosta
published
in

intreating
of

of

of
the
elements
mettalls
plants
and
beasts
which
are
proper
to
that
country
where
we
have
given
a
date
it
is
simply
that
of
the
copy
that
has
come
under
our
own
cognisance
many
of
those
works
were
of
sufficient
popularity
to
run
through
several
editions
sometimes
several
years
apart
still
the
dates
we
give
will
afford
an
approximate
notion
of
the
age
of
the
books
in
question
this
slight
sketch
of
medi
val
books
of
travel
might
very
readily
be
extended
we
do
but
introduce
them
as
illustrations
and
samples
of
the
mass
of
material
available
the
medical
treatises
of
our
forefathers
were
very
numerous
such
books
as
potter
s
booke
of
phisicke
and
chirurgery
or
cogan
s
haven
of
health
may
advantageously
be
consulted
the
copy
of
the
first
of
these
that
lies
open
before
us
as
we
write
is
dated
the
yeare
of
our
lorde
god
and
like
almost
all
these
old
books
is
more
or
less
of
a
compilation
full
of
divers
interesting
matters
necessary
to
be
knowne
and
collected
out
of
sundry
olde
written
bookes
cogan
is
very
frank
on
this
point
he
says
yet
one
thing
i
desire
of
all
them
that
shall
reade
this
booke
if
they
finde
whole
sentences
taken
out
of
master
eliot
his
castle
of
heath
or
out
of
schola
salerni
or
any
other
author
whatsoever
that
they
will
not
condemne
me
of
vaine
glorie
as
if
i
meant
to
set
forth
for
mine
owne
workes
that
which
other
men
have
devised
for
i
confess
that
i
have
taken
verbatim
out
of
other
wher
it
served
for
my
purpose
but
i
have
so
interlaced
it
with
mine
owne
that
as
i
think
it
may
be
the
better
perceived
and
therefore
seeing
all
my
travaile
tendeth
to
common
commodity
i
trust
every
man
will
interpret
all
to
the
best
his
statement
that
his
ingenious
interweaving
of
other
men
s
work
with
his
own
makes
the
plagiarism
and
appropriation
the
more
readily
detected
is
somewhat
difficult
to
follow
cogan
did
however
plagiarism
notwithstanding
take
up
a
somewhat
special
ground
that
supplied
the
raison
d
tre
of
his
book
since
he
tells
us
that
it
was
chiefly
gathered
for
the
comfort
of
students
and
consequently
of
all
those
that
have
a
care
for
their
health
there
are
repeated
references
to
the
oxford
scholars
thus
under
the
head
of
quinces
he
gives
a
receipt
for
marmalade
because
the
making
of
marmalade
is
a
pretty
conceit
and
may
perhaps
delight
some
painefull
student
that
will
be
his
own
apothecarie
elsewhere
we
are
told
of
cinamon
water
that
it
hath
innumerable
vertues
wherefore
i
reckon
it
a
great
treasure
for
a
student
to
have
by
him
in
his
closet
to
take
now
and
then
a
spoonfull
one
gets
some
interesting
side
light
thrown
on
the
university
life
of
that
day
cogan
s
book
we
may
mention
was
published
in
as
for
instance
when
we
are
told
that
when
foure
houres
bee
past
after
breakefast
a
man
may
safely
take
his
dinner
and
the
most
convenient
time
for
dinner
is
aboute
eleaven
of
the
clocke
before
noone
at
oxford
in
my
time
they
used
commonly
at
dinner
boyled
beefe
with
pottage
bread
and
beere
and
no
more
the
quantitie
of
beefe
was
in
value
one
halfepenny
for
one
man
and
sometimes
if
hunger
constrained
they
would
double
their
commons
judging
by
the
battels
we
have
had
the
felicity
of
paying
we
may
take
it
that
this
tariff
has
undergone
considerable
alteration
since
the
working
and
superintendence
of
the
printing
press
has
up
to
comparatively
recent
years
been
considered
such
essentially
masculine
labour
that
it
is
rather
curious
to
find
on
the
title
page
of
cogan
s
book
that
it
was
printed
by
anna
griffin
for
roger
ball
and
are
to
be
sold
at
his
shop
without
temple
barre
at
the
golden
anchor
as
the
ingredients
used
as
remedies
by
our
ancestors
came
largely
from
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
we
get
in
these
medical
works
a
good
deal
indirectly
of
natural
history
lore
thus
cogan
strongly
commends
the
eating
of
cabbage
leaves
as
a
preservative
of
the
stomache
from
surfetting
and
the
head
from
drunkennesse
raw
cabage
with
vinegar
so
much
as
he
list
the
philosophy
of
the
thing
is
that
the
vine
and
the
coleworts
be
so
contrarie
by
nature
that
if
you
plant
coleworts
neare
to
the
rootes
of
the
vine
of
it
selfe
it
will
flee
from
them
therefore
it
is
no
maruaile
if
coleworts
be
of
such
force
against
drunkennesse
macer
tells
of
the
virtue
of
fennel
as
a
restorative
of
youth
and
bases
his
treatment
on
the
assertion
that
serpentis
whan
thei
are
olde
and
willing
to
wexe
stronge
myghty
and
yongly
agean
thei
gon
and
eten
ofte
fenel
and
thei
become
yongliche
and
myghty
coles
in
his
adam
in
eden
commends
the
eyebright
as
a
remedy
for
weak
eyes
on
the
all
sufficient
ground
that
goldfinches
linnets
and
other
birds
eat
of
this
plant
to
strengthen
their
sight
many
of
these
prescriptions
of
our
grandfathers
great
grandfathers
would
have
supplied
ample
justification
for
action
on
the
part
of
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
had
so
invaluable
a
society
been
extant
in
those
good
old
times
of
bull
baiting
cock
throwing
brutality
thus
in
one
remedy
the
first
step
is
to
take
a
red
cock
pluck
him
alive
and
bruise
him
in
a
mortar
in
another
we
must
take
a
cat
cut
off
her
ears
and
tail
and
mix
the
blood
thereof
with
a
little
new
milk
while
the
victim
to
tight
boots
must
find
relief
for
his
blistered
heel
by
skinning
a
mouse
alive
and
laying
the
skin
while
still
warm
upon
the
injured
spot
scores
of
such
instances
of
selfish
indifference
to
suffering
could
readily
be
adduced
we
need
scarcely
pause
to
dwell
on
books
dealing
with
cookery
distillation
gardening
and
such
like
household
economics
though
it
will
be
readily
seen
how
in
these
again
the
natural
history
knowledge
or
want
of
it
of
our
ancestors
finds
room
for
its
display
but
pass
on
to
the
books
that
deal
with
animals
and
the
works
of
nature
generally
from
the
theological
point
of
view
the
bestiare
divin
of
guillaume
a
norman
priest
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
attempts
that
were
made
by
the
ecclesiastics
to
show
that
all
the
works
of
nature
were
symbols
and
teachers
of
great
divine
truths
the
ms
of
guillaume
dates
from
the
thirteenth
century
and
is
at
present
preserved
in
the
national
library
in
paris
the
work
has
been
very
well
reproduced
in
a
french
dress
by
hippeau
a
compatriot
of
the
author
of
it
the
statements
of
the
compiler
of
such
a
book
as
the
one
under
consideration
are
essentially
unreliable
since
it
was
very
difficult
for
him
to
ascertain
the
truth
and
he
had
in
addition
no
great
desire
to
be
literally
exact
and
was
at
any
moment
prepared
to
sacrifice
the
actual
facts
for
what
he
would
consider
a
higher
stratum
of
truth
he
could
not
be
accurate
if
he
would
and
would
not
if
he
could
hence
hippeau
in
estimating
the
value
of
the
book
very
justly
says

des

sur

ils
les
appuyaient
and
we
have
already
seen
that
augustine
considered
the
significance
that
could
be
wrung
out
of
a
statement
of
very
much
more
importance
than
any
adherence
to
the
facts
of
the
case

it
is
evident
that
whatever
of
value
or

may
be
evolved
on
the
strength
of
such
sentiments
the
result
can
hardly
be
called
natural
history
a
decision
that
we
have
already
arrived
at
in
our
consideration
of
the
speculum
mundi
the
bestiary
of
de
thaun
is
a
book
of
like
nature
only
one
copy
of
the
ms
is
known
that
in
the
cottonian
collection
of
another
of
his
books
the
livre
des
creatures
seven
copies
are
extant
the
author
had
as
his
great
patron
adelaide
of
louvain
the
second
queen
of
henry
i
of
england
and
to
her
he
dedicated
his
books
the
language
in
which
they
are
written
is

who

need
of

and

without

as
an
example
of
moral
making
we
may
instance
the
ylio
a
little
beast
made
like
a
lizard
and
which
we
imagine
must
be
the
salamander
de

says
that
it
is
of
such
a
nature
that
if
it
come
by
chance
where
there
shall
be
burning
fire
it
will
immediately
extinguish
it
the
beast
is
so
cold
and
of
such
a
quality
that
fire
will
not
be
able
to
burn
where
it

enter

of
such

signifies
such
men
as
was
ananias
as
was
azarias
as
was
misael
these
three
issued
from
the
fire
praising
god
he
who
has
faith
only
will
never
have
hurt
from
fire
of
the
aspis
he
tells
us
that
it
is
a
serpent
cunning
sly
and
aware
of
evil
when
it
perceives
people
who
make
enchantment
who
want
to
take
and
snare
it
it
will
stop
very
well
the
ears
it
has
it
will
press
one
against
the
earth
in
the
other
it
will
stuff
its
tail
firmly
so
that
it
hears
nothing
in
this
manner
do
the
rich
people
of
the
world
one
ear
they
have
on
earth
to
obtain
riches
the
other
sin
stops
up
yet
they
will
see
a
day
the
day
of
judgment
this
is
the
signification
of
the
aspis
without
doubt
in
like
manner
a
moral
is
tacked
on
to
every
creature
and
all
creation
is
shown
to
be

may

some
little

somewhat
of

to

short
reference
to
the

references
to
these
are
to

of
many
of

ancient
writers
such
as
homer
pliny
herodotus

mentions
them
in
his
geography
but
regards
the
belief
in
them
as
a
mere
fable
while
some
of
the
older
authors
suggest
that
very
possibly
exceptionally
large
monkeys
might
have
been
mistaken
for
exceptionally
small
men
while

writers
affirmed
that
such
a

was
to

met
with
in

aristotle

locating
them
at
the
head
of

them
in

extreme
north

the
rigour

homer
in

third
book
of
the
iliad
refers
to
the
conflicts
between
the
pygmies
and
the
cranes
when
inclement
winters
vex
the
plain
with
piercing
frosts
or
thick

and
death

bring
our
readers
may
possibly
wonder
as
we
have
done
why
the
cranes
should
bear
the
pygmies
such
ill
will
but
pliny
in
his
seventh
book
supplies
the
justification
for
the
feud
as
it
appears
that
in
the
spring
time
the
pygmies
sally
forth
in
great
troops
riding
upon
goats
searching
for
and
devouring
the
eggs
of
the
cranes
a
state
of
things
that
no
creature
of
proper
parental
instincts
could
be
expected
to
submit
quietly
to
sir
thomas
browne
in
his
excellent
book
on
vulgar
errors
says
that
homer
using
often
similes
as
well
to
delight
the
ear
as
to
illustrate
his
matter
compareth
the
trojanes
unto
cranes
when
they
descend
against
the
pigmies
which
was
more
largely
set
out
by
oppian
juvenall
and
many
poets
since
and
being
only
a
pleasant
figment
in
the
fountain
became
a
solemn
story
in
the
stream
and
current
still
among
us
he
declines
to
give
credence
to
the
pygmies
and
the
tales
that
appertain
to
them
and
says
that
julius
scaliger
a
diligent
enquirer
accounts
thereof
but
as
a
poeticall
fiction
ulysses
aldrovandus
a
most
careful
zoographer
in
an
expresse
discourse
thereon
concludes
the
story
fabulous
albertus
magnus
a
man
ofttimes
too
credulous
was
herein
more
than
dubious
and
though
he
quotes
the
statement
of
pigafeta
that
pygmies
were
found
in
the
moluccas
and
that
of
olaus
magnus
as
to
their
being
encountered
in

declares
that
yet

a
matter
so
confirmable

affirmation

but
slow
perswation
maundevile
of
course
is
as

to

in

existence
of

as
of
most
other
things

bishop
jordanus
in
his
mirabilia
descripta
tells
of
pygmies
in
an
exceeding
great
island
what
is
called
jaua
which
our
readers
who
are
at
all
used
to
the
substitution
of
the
letter
u
for
v
will
at
once
recognize
as
java
where
are
many
world
s
wonders
among
which
beside
the
finest
aromatic
spices
this
is
one
to
wit
that
there
be
found
pygmy
men
of
the
size
of
a
boy
of
three
or
four
years
old
all
shaggy
like
a
goat
he
adds
that
they
dwell
in
the
woods
and
we
may
not
unreasonably
conclude
that
these
hirsute
arboreals
were
a
species
of
ape
illustration
fig
in
the
conflict
of
testimony
some
affirming
and
some
denying
the
existence
of
such
a
people
marco
polo
writing
it
will
be
remembered
in
the
thirteenth
century
warns
us
that
we
must
beware
of
counterfeits
that
are
palmed
off
on
the
unwary
as
the
real
thing
it
should
be
known
says
he
that
what
is
reported
respecting
the
dried
bodies
of
diminutive
human
creatures
or
pigmies
brought
from
india
is
an
idle
tale
such
pretended
men
being
manufactured
in
the
following
manner
the
country
produces
a
species
of
monkey
of
a
tolerable
size
and
having
a
countenance
resembling
that
of
a
man
those
persons
who
make
it
their
business
to
catch
them
shave
off
the
hair
leaving
it
only
about
the
chin
and
those
other
parts
where
it
naturally
grows
on
the
human
body
they
then
dry
and
preserve
them
with
camphor
and
other
drugs
and
having
prepared
them
in
such
a
mode
that
they
have
exactly
the
appearance
of
little
men
they
put
them
into
wooden
boxes
and
sell
them
to
trading
people
who
carry
them
to
all
parts
of
the
world
but
this
is
an
imposition
and
neither
in
india
nor
in
any
other
country
however
wild
or
little
known
have
pigmies
been
found
of
a
form
so
diminutive
as
these
exhibited
it
will
be
noted
that
the
very
fact
of
a
counterfeit
implies
a
something
to
be
counterfeited
and
marco
polo
is
clearly
quite
prepared
to
give
in
his
adhesion
to
the
affirmative
side
the
belief
in
a
pygmy
race
first
declared
centuries
before
the
christian
era
was
held
most
fully
in
medi
val
days
and
modern
travel
and
research
has
amply
proved
that
various
elements
of
the
marvelous
stripped
away
the
belief
was
a
sound
one
du
chaillu
in
western
equatorial
africa
met
with
a
diminutive
race
of
which
the
average
height
of
the
individuals
who
would
submit
to
measurement
was
four
feet
five
inches
and
readers
of
stanley
s
books
will
recall
his
experiences
with
a
similar
people
on
the
authority
of
dr
parke
the
mikaba
average
four
feet
one
inch
the
batwas
four
feet
three
inches
and
the
akkas
four
feet
six
inches
related
to
them
in
shortness
of
stature
are
the
bushmen
of
southern
africa
averaging
about
four
feet
seven
inches
in
height
and
elsewhere
the
lapps
the
fuegians
the
ainos
of
japan
and
the
veddahs
all
people
of
notoriously
short
stature
probably
the
bushmen
or
bosjesmen
are
the
modern
representatives
of
the
pygmaioi
for
in
their
cave
dwelling
reptile
eating
and
other
peculiarities
they
agree
entirely
with
the
descriptions
given
by
herodotus
pliny
and
other
ancient
writers
the
bosjesmen
are
found
with
all
the
peculiarities
of
their
dwarfish
race
intact
as
far
north
as
guinea
winwood
reade
in
his
savage
africa
gives
many
interesting
details
concerning
them
and
holds
the
view
that
they
were
the
aboriginal
race
in
africa
dr
stuhlmann
emin
pacha
s
companion
in
many
of
his
wanderings
succeeded
for
the
first
time
in
bringing
pygmies
alive
to
europe
some
members
of
the
akka
tribe
being
brought
to
berlin
where
they
were
regarded
with
immense
interest
by
the
professors
of
anthropology
the
truthfulness
of
the
ancient
geographers
being
thus
confirmed
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
tales
of
the
conflicts
of
the
pygmies
with
great
birds
may
have
a
more
solid
foundation
of
fact
than
we
are
quite
prepared
to
admit
the
maori
traditions
tell
of
the
contests
with
the
moa
and
other
gigantic
birds
which
formerly
inhabited
the
islands
of
new
zealand
while
the
jesuit
missionaries
give
accounts
of
enormous
birds
once
found
in
abyssinia
and
madagascar
all
these
are
now
extinct
but
it
may
well
be
that
to
a
dwarf
race
armed
only
with
bows
and
arrows
such
birds
would
be
foes
by
no
means
to
be
despised
one
finds
the
trustworthiness
of
the
old
writers
often
so
curiously
confirmed
that
one
hesitates
in
the
case
of
many
of
them
to
assume
too
readily
either
gross
credulity
or
a
willful
misstatement
amidst
the
millions
of
births
in
the
animal
creation
there
is
scarcely
any
conceivable
malformation
excess
or
defect
of
parts
that
has
not
at
some
time
or
other
occurred
anyone
turning
to
the
medical
and
surgical
journals
will
find
many
strange
illustrations
of
this
or
our
readers
may
find
much
interesting
information
on
this
subject
and
given
in
a
less
technical
form
in
the
histoire
g
n
rale
des
anomalies
of
geoffroi
de
st
hilaire
but
such
malformations
occur
singly
and
at
comparatively
remote
intervals
the
anomalous
departure
from
the
type
the
eccentricity
of
structure
is
not
hereditarily
produced
does
not
become
the
starting
point
of
a
new
species
no
natural
malformation
allowance
being
made
for
the
very
restricted
influence
of
hybridism
ever
passes
outside
the
species
in
which
it
is
found
or
combines
with
it
the
character
of
any
other
creature
while
even
the
limited
possibilities
of
hybridism
have
a
tendency
to
die
out
owing
to
the
sterility
that
is
so
marked
a
characteristic
such
monsters
as
aldrovandus
figures
are
utterly
impossible
such
as
the
body
of
a
man
conjoined
to
the
head
of
an
ass
and
having
one
foot
that
of
an
eagle
and
the
other
that
of
an
elephant
abundant
illustrations
of
the
most
un
natural
history
may
be
found
in
the
works
of
aldrovandus
his
voluminous
works
on
animals
are
very
curious
and
interesting
and
are
richly
illustrated
with
engravings
at
least
as
quaint
in
character
as
the
text
his
monstrorum
historia
published
in
folio
at
bologna
in
is
a
perfect
treasure
house
of
rank
impossibilities
another
book
of
very
similar
character
is
boiastuau
s
histoires
prodigeuses
published
in
paris
in
the
year
a
strange
assemblage
of
curious
and
monstrous
figures
the
wondrous
creatures
of
aldrovandus
and
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
are
given
in
the
most
perfect
good
faith
as
contributions
towards
a
better
knowledge
of
natural
history
are
divisible
into
three
classes
creatures
that
are
absolute
impossibilities
such
as
fig
a
man
having
the
head
and
neck
of
a
crane
secondly
various
species
of
malformation
and
abnormal
growth
which
do
undoubtedly
occur
from
time
to
time
and
thirdly
other
forms
suggested
by
this
second
class
but
carried
to
altogether
impossible
excess
it
is
of
course
easy
having
realized
that
a
lizard
with
a
forked
tail
is
somewhat
of
a
curiosity
to
make
a
much
greater
wonder
by
representing
as
he
does
a
ten
tailed
lizard
and
while
a
boy
born
without
arms
is
a
painful
possibility
the
wonder
is
undoubtedly
greatly
increased
by
also
cutting
off
his
legs
as
aldrovandus
does
and
replacing
them
with
the
tail
of
a
fish
the
creature
he
calls
hippopos
having
the
head
arms
and
body
of
a
man
but
terminating
below
in
the
legs
and
hoofs
of
a
horse
was
though
here
only
two
legged
probably
suggested
by
the
centaur
myth
amongst
the
other
impossibilities
which
we
must
nevertheless
again
remind
our
readers
the
old
writer
brings
forward
in
the
most
perfect
sincerity
as
valuable
aids
to
a
better
knowledge
of
the
wonders
of
creation
is
a
man
of
normal
growth
except
that
he
has
the
head
of
a
wolf
the
lady
fig
who
is
distinctly
of
harpy
type
a
ram
headed
individual
and
a
boy
with
the
head
of
an
elephant
illustration
fig
this
notion
of
the
substitution
of
heads
has
a
great
charm
for
aldrovandus
he
gives
us
elsewhere
a
bird
headed
boy
and
horses
goats
pigs
and
lions
all
with
human
heads
while
the
monstrum
triceps
capite
vulpis
draconis
et
aquil
is
we
venture
to
think
a
creature
that
neither
aldrovandus
nor
anyone
else
ever
did
see
or
ever
will
see
according
to
the
picture
it
had
a
human
body
and
legs
differing
however
from
those
of
ordinary
humanity
in
being
clothed
with
large
scales
one
arm
was
like
that
of
a
man
the
other
was
the
wing
of
an
eagle
and
a
horse
s
tail
in
rear
was
another
distinctly
abnormal
growth
while
surmounting
all
were
three
heads
those
of
a
wolf
a
dragon
and
an
eagle
there
are
many
other
such
atrocities
while
they
are
curious
as
showing
the
depth
of
credulity
our
forefathers
could
reach
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
they
are
the
dullest
things
possible
anyone
with
a
slight
knowledge
of
zoology
could
create
them
by
the
score
placing
for
instance
on
the
neck
of
a
giraffe
the
head
of
an
elephant
giving
it
the
body
of
an
alligator
and
finishing
off
all
neatly
with
the
tail
of
a
peacock
the
multiplication
or
suppression
or
distortion
of
various
parts
is
a
very
strong
point
with
aldrovandus
he
illustrates
for
our
benefit
four
legged
ducks
and
pigeons
and
two
headed
pigs
sheep
cows
and
fishes
calves
dogs
hares
each
walking
erect
on
their
hind
legs
and
having
no
front
ones
and
pigs
cats
dogs
chickens
double
bodied
but
single
headed
he
also
tells
us
of
headless
men
and
gives
us
a
drawing
of
one
neckless
having
the
ears
rising
from
the
shoulders
mouthless
the
nose
a
proboscis
a
foot
or
so
in
length
this
and
the
eyes
are
on
the
back
of
the
figure
fig
we
may
fairly
include
as
an
example
of
distortion
while
fig
is
a
monstrosity
produced
by
suppression
in
another
place
he
gives
a
drawing
of
a
man
having
two
eyes
in
their
natural
position
and
beyond
each
of
these
another
so
that
we
have
four
in
a
row
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
one
quaint
picture
shows
us
two
men
wearing
large
ruffs
and
habited
in
quite
the
costume
of
the
upper
ten
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
their
faces
are
covered
with
thickly
matted
hair
their
eyes
peeping
out
like
those
of
a
skye
terrier
this
idea
was
too
grotesque
not
to
utilize
to
the
uttermost
so
the
next
picture
in
the
book
is
that
of
a
young
lady
in
the
same
plight
the
notion
of
hairy
men
tailed
men
and
the
like
has
no
doubt
arisen
from
the
first
introduction
of
the
early
writers
and
voyagers
to
various
species
of
monkeys
duris
one
of
the
ancients
professed
to
know
of
the
existence
of
an
indian
tribe
of
shaggy
tailed
men
while
ctesias
not
to
fall
short
in
this
pursuit
of
the
marvellous
tells
us
of
a
certain
indian
valley
or
more
probably
a
very
uncertain
one
and
exceedingly
difficult
to
locate
where
the
inhabitants
lived
two
hundred
years
having
in
their
youth
white
hair
which
with
the
ravages
of
time
gradually
became
quite
black
in
the
periplus
of
hanno
about
five
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
we
have
an
unquestionable
reference
to
the
apes
for
three
days
says
the
carthaginian
admiral
we
passed
along
a
burning
coast
and
at
length
reached
a
bay
called
the
southern
horn
in
the
bottom
of
this
bay
we
found
an
island
which
was
inhabited
by
wild
men
the
greater
number
of
those
we
saw
were
females
they
were
covered
with
hair
and
our
interpreters
called
them
gorilloi
we
were
unable
to
secure
any
of
the
men
as
they
fled
to
the
mountains
and
defended
themselves
with
stones
as
to
the
women
we
caught
three
of
them
but
they
so
bit
and
scratched
us
that
we
found
it
impossible
to
bring
them
along
we
therefore
killed
and
flayed
them
and
carried
their
hides
to
carthage
rather
a
cool
proceeding
this
granting
either
that
they
were
really
human
or
that
the
carthaginians
regarded
them
as
such
we
should
at
all
events
so
regard
it
nowadays
if
for
instance
the
crew
of
a
whaler
flayed
some
eskimo
ladies
and
brought
their
hides
to
dundee
burton
and
other
early
english
writers
thoroughly
believe
in
the
existence
of
tailed
men
and
it
has
long
been
an
article
of
belief
that
divers
men
even
in
this
realm
of
england
were
born
with
tails
the
devonshire
men
stoutly
contended
that
their
cornish
neighbors
were
thus
distinguished
according
to
polydore
vergil
some
at
least
of
the
men
of
kent
shared
this
peculiarity
and
he
very
definitely
asserts
that
it
was
a
divine
judgment
upon
them
for
insulting
one
of
his
servants
thomas
becket
he
tells
us
that
when
that
prelate
fell
into
disgrace
with
his
sovereign
many
people
treated
him
with
but
little
respect
and
in
rochester
he
met
with
such
contempt
that
amongst
other
marks
of
contumely
the
tail
of
the
horse
on
which
he
was
riding
was
cut
off
by
this
profane
inhospitality
they
reaped
deserved
reproach
for
all
the
offspring
of
the
men
who
did
or
connived
at
this
thing
were
born
with
tails
like
horses
this
mark
of
infamy
we
are
told
only
disappeared
with
the
gradual
extinction
of
those
whose
forefathers
had
incurred
this
notorious
and
shameful
penalty
in
the
loyal
scot
of
andrew
marvel
we
find
the
line
for
becket
s
sake
kent
always
shall
have
tails
as
a
line
or
two
before
this
he
has
written
deliver
us
from
a
bishop
s
wrath
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
the
passage
alludes
to
the
legend
referred
to
john
bale
the
writer
of
the
actes
of
english
votaries
is
righteously
indignant
on
the
point
he
writes
as
follows
in
his
book
john
capgrave
and
alexander
of
esseby
sayth
that
for
castynge
of
fyshe
tayles
at
thys
augustyne
dorsettshyre
men
had
tayles
ever
after
but
polydorus
applieth
it
unto
kentish
men
at
strood
by
rochester
for
cuttynge
of
thomas
becket
s
horse
s
tail
thus
hath
england
in
all
other
land
a
perpetual
infamy
of
tayles
by
these
wrytten
legendes
of
lyes
an
englyshman
cannot
now
travayle
in
another
land
by
way
of
marchandyse
or
any
other
honest
occupynge
but
it
is
most
contumeliously
thrown
in
his
teethe
that
all
englyshmen
have
tayles
that
uncomely
note
and
report
hath
the
nation
gotten
without
recover
by
these
laisy
and
idle
lubbers
the
monkes
and
the
priestes
which
could
find
no
matters
to
advance
their
gaines
by
or
their
saintes
as
they
call
them
but
manifest
lies
and
knaveries
john
bale
was
a
post
reformation
bishop
holding
the
see
of
ossory
during
the
reign
of
edward
vi
and
was
especially
notable
for
his
zeal
in
spreading
the
principles
of
the
reformed
church
john
struys
a
dutchman
who
visited
formosa
in
the
year
gives
a
description
of
a
tailed
man
that
is
strongly
suggestive
of
the
monkey
theory
except
that
he
endows
him
with
intelligible
speech
he
tells
us
that
before
he
visited
this
island
he
had
often
heard
of
men
therein
who
had
long
tails
but
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
credit
it
seeing
however
is
proverbially
believing
i
should
now
have
difficulty
in
accepting
it
he
writes
if
my
own
senses
had
not
removed
from
me
every
pretence
for
doubting
the
fact
by
the
following
strange
adventure
the
inhabitants
of
formosa
being
used
to
see
us
were
in
the
habit
of
receiving
us
on
terms
which
left
nothing
to
apprehend
on
either
side
so
that
although
mere
foreigners
we
always
believed
ourselves
to
be
in
safety
and
had
grown
familiar
enough
to
ramble
at
large
without
an
escort
when
grave
experience
taught
us
that
in
so
doing
we
were
hazarding
too
much
as
some
of
our
party
were
one
day
taking
a
stroll
one
of
them
had
occasion
to
withdraw
about
a
stone
s
throw
from
the
rest
who
being
at
the
moment
engaged
in
an
eager
conversation
proceeded
without
heeding
the
disappearance
of
their
companion
after
awhile
however
his
absence
was
observed
and
the
party
paused
thinking
he
would
rejoin
them
they
waited
some
time
but
at
last
tired
of
the
delay
they
returned
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
they
remembered
to
have
seen
him
last
arriving
there
they
were
horrified
to
find
his
mangled
body
lying
on
the
ground
while
some
remained
to
watch
the
dead
body
others
went
off
in
search
of
the
murderer
and
these
had
not
gone
far
when
they
came
upon
a
man
of
peculiar
appearance
who
finding
himself
enclosed
by
the
exploring
party
so
as
to
make
escape
from
them
impossible
began
to
foam
with
rage
and
by
cries
and
wild
gesticulations
to
intimate
that
he
would
make
anyone
repent
the
attempt
who
should
venture
to
meddle
with
him
the
fierceness
of
his
desperation
for
a
time
kept
our
people
at
bay
but
as
his
fury
gradually
subsided
they
gathered
more
closely
around
him
and
at
length
seized
him
as
the
crime
was
so
atrocious
and
if
allowed
to
pass
with
impunity
might
entail
even
more
serious
consequences
it
was
determined
to
burn
the
man
he
was
tied
up
to
a
stake
where
he
was
kept
for
some
hours
before
the
time
of
execution
arrived
it
was
then
that
i
beheld
what
i
had
never
thought
to
see
he
had
a
tail
more
than
a
foot
long
covered
with
red
hair
and
very
much
like
that
of
a
cow
when
he
saw
the
surprise
that
this
discovery
created
amongst
the
european
spectators
he
informed
us
that
his
tail
was
the
effect
of
climate
for
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
southern
side
of
the
island
where
they
then
were
were
provided
with
like
appendages
the
measure
of
burning
the
man
to
avoid
any
future
unpleasantness
seems
a
somewhat
strong
one
and
attended
with
a
very
considerable
element
of
risk
to
themselves
besides
the
grave
personal
inconvenience
to
the
victim
the
account
is
a
very
circumstantial
one
how
is
it
to
be
explained
one
cannot
accept
the
tail
or
the
tale
and
yet
it
is
painful
to
feel
that
the
alternative
is
to
brand
john
struys
as
deliberately
errant
from
the
truth
and
brave
men
who
take
their
lives
in
their
hands
are
above
the
meanness
of
vapouring
or
lying
in
such
a
case
one
agrees
entirely
with
dr
johnson
of
a
standing
fact
sir
there
ought
to
be
no
controversy
if
there
are
men
with
tails
catch
a
homo
caudatus
africa
and
india
the
two
great
wonder
lands
of
our
forefathers
were
the
home
of
many
strange
specimens
of
humanity
far
away
towards
the
sources
of
the
nile
were
the
nigri
ruled
by
a
king
who
had
but
one
eye
and
that
in
the
midst
of
his
forehead
there
too
were
found
the
agriophagi
a
people
who
lived
on
the
flesh
of
lions
and
panthers
the
anthropophagi
that
fed
on
the
flesh
of
men
and
the
pomphagi
that
like
the
modern
schoolboy
eat
all
things
in
that
mysterious
land
too
dwelt
the
cynamolgi
whose
heads
were
those
of
dogs
one
old
writer
tells
us
that
there
was
a
tribe
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
of
these
dog
headed
men
they
wore
the
skins
of
wild
animals
as
their
clothing
and
carried
on
conversation
in
true
canine
style
by
yelps
and
barks
sir
john
maundevile
of
course
knew
all
about
these
folk
since
he
found
a
great
and
fair
island
somewhere
called
nacumera
that
was
more
than
a
thousand
miles
in
circuit
and
which
had
no
other
population
he
tells
us
that
they
were
a
very
reasonable
people
and
of
good
understanding
the
only
fault
that
he
finds
with
them
being
that
they
worship
an
ox
as
their
god
jordanus
burton
and
others
locate
these
peculiar
people
in
india
jordanus
says
that
there
are
many
different
islands
in
which
the
men
have
the
heads
of
dogs
but
the
women
are
purely
human
and
moreover
very
beautiful
whereat
he
very
justly
observes
i
cease
not
to
marvel
ibn
bakuta
describing
the
people
of
barah
nakar
says
their
men
are
of
the
same
form
as
ourselves
except
that
their
mouths
are
like
those
of
dogs
but
the
women
have
mouths
like
other
folks
aldrovandus
naturally
does
not
miss
such
a
chance
as
the
dog
headed
people
afford
him
vicentius
places
them
in
tartary
and
marco
polo
heard
of
them
in
the
island
of
angaman
in
ethiopia
we
hear
of
a
tribe
of
men
that
elected
a
dog
as
their
king
and
judged
as
best
they
might
by
his
actions
and
barking
the
royal
commands
ethiopia
was
a
land
of
marvels
the
focus
and
centre
of
all
the
wonders
of
africa
it
was
held
that
the
strange
and
monstrous
forms
there
produced
arose
from
the
agility
of
the
fiery
heat
to
frame
bodies
and
to
carve
them
into
strange
shapes
it
was
reported
by
some
that
far
within
the
interior
of
the
country
were
to
be
found
whole
nations
of
noseless
men
and
that
others
were
without
the
upper
lip
while
others
again
were
without
speech
and
only
made
communication
by
signs
it
is
easy
to
see
how
the
notion
of
a
noseless
people
originated
since
the
negro
physiognomy
often
has
the
nose
a
very
flattened
feature
while
the
people
who
could
only
make
signs
to
the
strangers
that
came
amongst
them
evidently
did
so
from
a
full
realization
of
the
hopelessness
of
speech
the
negro
lip
is
ordinarily
a
very
conspicuous
feature
so
that
the
lipless
people
were
a
legitimate
object
of
wonder
in
one
district
all
the
four
footed
beasts
were
without
ears
even
the
elephants
the
old
author
is
careful
to
add
being
in
the
same
plight
our
readers
will
doubtless
remember
that
the
ears
of
the
african
elephant
outside
this
district
are
of
enormous
size
and
form
one
marked
difference
between
him
and
his
asiatic
brother
elsewhere
in
this
wondrous
land
we
hear
of
men
having
three
and
four
eyes
but
the
old
traveller
carefully
explains
that
this
tale
merely
arose
not
because
they
are
thus
furnished
but
because
they
are
excellent
archers
the
because
is
not
very
evident
as
the
keenness
and
excellence
of
sight
that
would
be
of
such
value
to
an
archer
is
scarcely
to
be
obtained
by
the
multiplication
of
eyes
it
is
quality
rather
than
quantity
that
is
needed
here
and
the
old
writer
is
careful
to
add
thus
much
must
i
advertise
my
readers
that
i
will
not
pawn
my
credit
for
many
things
that
i
shall
deliver
what
he
saw
for
himself
he
could
vouch
for
and
these
things
were
themselves
so
strange
that
he
could
scarcely
refuse
to
credit
some
of
the
wonders
that
were
by
hearsay
but
he
very
justly
declines
responsibility
another
old
writer
burton
in
the
same
way
cautiously
evades
fathering
all
the
wonderful
tales
he
tells
of
the
men
who
live
by
scent
alone
of
those
who
by
eating
the
heart
and
liver
of
a
dragon
attain
to
the
understanding
of
the
language
of
beasts
of
those
who
have
the
power
of
making
themselves
invisible
and
so
forth
but
of
these
i
doubt
not
but
that
the
understanding
reader
knoweth
how
to
judge
and
what
to
believe
on
the
isle
called
dondum
an
island
that
maundevile
seems
to
have
discovered
or
developed
from
his
inner
consciousness
are
folk
of
gret
stature
as
geauntes
and
thei
ben
hidouse
for
to
loke
upon
and
thei
han
but
on

and
that
is
in
the
myddylle
of
the
front
and
thei
eten
no
thing
but
raw
flessche
and
raw
fyssche
and
in
another
yle
towards
the
southe
duellen
folk
of
foule
stature
and
of
cursed
kynde
that
han
no
hedes
and
here
eyen
ben
in
here
scholdres
these
are
both
mentioned
by
pliny
but
this
passage
of
maundevile
must
not
be
considered
as
confirmatory
of
pliny
s
wonders
as
it
is
considerably
less
probable
that
the
medi
val
writer
had
seen
these
monsters
than
that
he
had
seen
the
olden
book
and
transferred
its
wonders
to
his
own
pages
he
in
fact
distinctly
tells
us
that
his
nerves
would
not
stand
an
interview
with
these
giants
sume
of
forty
five
fote
or
fifty
fote
long
i
saghe
none
of
tho
for
i
had
no
lust
to
go
he
tells
us
however
of
the
geauntes
scheep
als
gret
as
oxen
here
and
thei
beren
gret
wolle
and
roughe
of
these
scheep
i
have
seyn
many
tymes
these
we
may
reasonably
conclude
to
have
been
yak
as
he
tells
us
that
men
have
often
seen
the
geauntes
taken
men
in
the
sea
out
of
hire
schippes
and
broughte
hem
to

two
in
one
hond
and
two
in
another
etynge
hem
goynge
alle
rawe
and
alle
quyk
we
can
readily
understand
his
reluctance
to
visit
them
elsewhere
he
professes
to
have
found
wylde
men
hidouse
to
loken
on
for
thei
ben
horned
and
thei
speken
nought
but
thei
gronten
as
pygges
in
yet
another
yle
ben
folk
so
at
least
maundevile
tells
us
though
it
may
be
but
a
traveller
s
tale
that
are
of
such
fasceon
and
schapp
that
han
the
lippe
above
the
mouthe
so
gret
that
whan
thei
slepen
in
the
sonne
thei
kovoren
alle
the
face
with
that
lippe
this
story
again
is
probably
less
a
personal
experience
than
a
proof
of
scholarship
as
strabo
describes
such
a
people
in
his
writings
these
great
lipped
people
have
as
neighbours
lytylle
folk
that
han
no
mouthe
but
in
stede
therof
thei
han
a

and
whan
thei

and
therefor
thei

not
but
thei
maken
a
manner
of
hyssynge
as
a
neddre
dothe
pliny
isidore
strabo
and
other
ancient
authorities
on
the
subject
tell
of
a
tribe
that
have
ears
so
long
and
pendulous
that
they
reach
to
their
knees
and
therefore
maundevile
knew
of
them
too
and
as
pliny
knew
of
the
hippopodes
so
the
medi
val
writer
tells
us
of
folk
that
han
hors
feet
these
thanks
we
may
assume
to
this
peculiarity
are
a
nation
of
very
swift
runners
easily
beating
the
record
of
any
of
our
modern
athletes
hence
they
are
able
to
capture
wylde
bestes
with
rennyng
and
add
them
to
their
bill
of
fare
amongst
other
strange
specimens
of
humanity
that
we
encounter
in
the
pages
of
maundevile
if
not
in
the
flesh
are
the
peculiarly
strange
folk
that
gon
upon
hire
hondes
and
hire
feet
as
bestes
and
thei
ben
all
skynned
and
fedred
and
thei
lepen
als
lightly
in
to
trees
and
fro
tree
to
tree
as
it
were
squyrelles
in
one
district
the
people
subsist
chiefly
on
adders
partly
because
there
is
gret
plentee
of
them
but
more
especially
from
appreciation
thei
eten
them
at
gret
sollempnytees
and
he
that
makethe
there
a
feste
be
it
nevere
so
costifous
and
he
han
no
neddres
he
hathe
no
thanke
for
his
travaylle
it
would
in
fact
be
a
parallel
atrocity
to
a
gathering
of
the
city
fathers
at
the
mansion
house
and
no
turtle
soup
provided
the
long
headed
people
that
formed
part
of
the
strange
african
fraternity
we
may
reasonably
conclude
to
have
owed
their
peculiarity
to
the
habit
of
employing
pressure
to
mould
the
head
into
the
compressed
and
elongated
form
in
just
the
same
way
that
in
recent
times
the
heads
of
some
of
the
tribes
of
north
american
indians
were
manipulated
we
may
not
unreasonably
conclude
too
that
some
at
least
of
the
various
curious
people
referred
to
by
the
ancient
and
medi
val
writers
were
but
accidental
monstrosities
malformations
of
rare
or
casual
occurrence
such
an
one
appearing
amongst
strangers
would
be
regarded
with
great
curiosity
and
it
would
be
but
a
short
step
farther
to
the
lover
of
the
marvellous
to
assume
that
somewhere
or
other
in
the
region
from
whence
he
sprang
was
a
whole
tribe
or
nation
of
such
the
accidental
resemblances
too
that
we
sometimes
see
in
the
human
physiognomy
to
animals
would
be
suggestive
material
to
those
in
search
of
the
wonderful
porta
s
book
de
humana
physiognomonica
gives
many
illustrations
of
heads
animal
and
human
showing
resemblance
of
the
men
s
heads
to
those
of
the
owl
lion
ox
and
other
creatures
some
of
these
are
very
clever
while
others
are
absurdly
forced
and
exaggerated
munster
under
the
section
de

gives
a
picture
in
his
book
where
our
old
friend
the
man
with
the
single
immense
foot
the
one
eyed
man
a
two
headed
fellow
the
headless
man
with
his
eyes
and
other
features
in
his
chest
whose
acquaintance
we
have
made
in
fig
and
a
wolf
headed
man
are
all
grouped
together
as
a
matter
of
course
leaving
the
observer
to
conclude
that
anyone
strolling
through
central
africa
would
any
day
expect
to
come
across
such
a
gathering
the
classic

of

pliny
writes
of
the
gipan
half
beasts
shaped
as
you
see
them
commonly
painted
a
terse
description
that
may
have
been
amply
sufficient
for
his
original
readers
but
which
leaves
later
generations
considerably
in
the
dark
the
belief
in
the
mermaid
was
to
our
ancestors
as
real
as
the
belief
in
the
mackerel
and
though
we
have
in
these
later
days
surrounded
all
with
an
air
of
romance
the
mermaid
was
to
them
no
myth
or
poetic
fancy
but
as
genuine
an
article
of
credence
as
any
other
creature
of
earth
or
air
or
sea
phisiologus
simply
calls
it
a
beast
of
the
sea
which
is
a
very
unpoetic
definition
indeed
while
boswell
in
like
manner
calls
it
a
sea
beast
wonderfully
shapen
nowadays
one
s
notion
of
a
mermaid
is
of
a
fair
creature
half
woman
half
fish
basking
amongst
the
rocks
or
rocking
on
the
waves
and
engaged
in
nothing
more
arduous
than
alternately
combing
her
flowing
golden
tresses
in
the
sunlight
and
gazing
in
her
constant
travelling
companion
her
mirror
to
study
the
effect
of
her
work
the
medi
val
mermaid
was
of
sterner
temper
one
old
writer
says
that
they
please
shipmen
greatly
with
their
song
that
they
draw
them
to
peril
and
shipwreck
while
another
affirms
that
this
beast
is
glad
and
merry
in
tempest
and
heavy
and
sad
in
faire
weather
b
wulf
the
saxon
poet
styles
the
mermaid
the
sea
wolf
of
the
abyss
the
mighty
sea
woman
the
syren
myth
of
the
ancients
is
clearly
the
origin
of
this
belief
in
the
malevolence
of
the
mermaid
these
syrens
to
quote
spencer
s
fairie
queen
were
faire
ladies
till
they
fondly
strived
with
th
heliconian
maides
for
mastery
of
whom
they
overcomen
were
depriv
d
of
their
proud
beautie
and
th

d
to

for
their
bold
surquedry
but
th
upper
half
their
hew
retayned
still
and
their
sweet
skill
in
wonted
melody
which
ever
after
they
abused
to
ill
t
allure
weake
travellers
whom
gotten
they
did
kill
the
writer
of
the
speculum
mundi
believed
in
mermaids
as
firmly
as
his
contemporaries
did
but
he
departs
somewhat
from
the
traditional
lines
of
belief
and
instead
of
making
his
mermaids
brewers
of
the
storms
sees
in
them
merely
rather
exceptionally
weather
wise
and
gifted
prophets
of
the
coming
tempest
he
says
of
them
the
mermaids
and
men
fish
seem
to
me
the
most
strange
fish
in
the
waters
some
have
supposed
them
to
be
devils
or
spirits
in
regard
of
their
whooping
noise
that
they
make
for
as
if
they
had
power
to
raise
extraordinary
storms
and
tempests
the
windes
blow
seas
rage
and
clouds
drop
presently
after
they
seem
to
call
this
was
the
popular
belief
but
he
explains
matters
as
follows
questionlesse
that
nature
s
instinct
makes
in
them
a
quicker
insight
and
more
sudden
feeling
and
foresight
of
those
things
than
is
in
man
which
we
see
even
in
other
creatures
upon
earth
as
fowles
who
feeling
the
alteration
of
the
aire
in
their
feathers
and
quills
do
plainly
prognosticate
a
change
of
weather
before
it
appeareth
to
us
so
that
really
the
bellowing
of
these
maidens
is
brought
down
to
the
level
of
cock
crowing
the
braying
of
the
ass
or
the
scream
of
the
peacock
as
indications
of
weather
changes
the
classic
writers
limited
the
number
of
their
syrens
to
three
ordinarily
though
they
were
not
quite
unanimous
as
to
the
exact
number
while
the
medi
val
mermaids
were
simply
as
unnumbered
and
as
un
named
denizens
of
the
deep
as
the
cod
fish
in
medi
val
times
the
mermaidens
were
not
ordinarily
credited
with
any
particular
musical
gifts
though
we
remember
seeing
a
gothic
carving
of
one
playing
on
a
violin
it
will
be
remembered
that
with
their
antique
prototypes
the
musical
part
of
the
entertainment
was
a
very
conspicuous
feature
withe

we
will
consider

the
mermaid
of
the
artist
and
the
poet
and
then
see
how
the
poetic
and
artistic
type
tallies
with
or
differs
from
the
mermaid
as
the
ancient
voyager
vouches
for
her
from
ocular
demonstration
naturally
the
poets
were
unwilling
to
surrender
the
sweet
song
of
the
mermaid
and
the
bellowing
and
whooping
of
the
matter
of
fact
naturalists
becomes
with
the
poets
a
dulcet
and
harmonious
breath
all
our
readers
must
be
familiar
with
the
beautiful
passage
in
the
midsummer
night
s
dream
i
sat
upon
a
promontory
and
heard
a
mermaid
on
a
dolphin
s
back
uttering
such
dulcet
and
harmonious
breath
that
the
rude
sea
grew
civil
at
her
song
and
certain
stars
shot
madly
from
their
spheres
to
hear
the
sea
maid
s
music
several
other
allusions
to
the
mermaid
will
be
found
in
the
writings
of
shakespeare
and
many
others
of
our
poets
though
it
would
be
somewhat
foreign
to
our
purpose
to
quote
them
at
any
length
fascinating
as
the
subject
would
be
our
present
prosaic
intent
is
but
to
introduce
the
poets
as
witnesses
to
the
widespread
belief
in
such
a
creature
as
the
mermaid
and
to
show
their
sympathy
with
it
in
medi
val
heraldry
the
mermaid
frequently
appears
as
a
charge
upon
the
shield
as
a
supporter
of
the
arms
and
as
the
surmounting
crest
any
book
upon
heraldry
will
supply
illustrations
of
this
we
need
only
now
refer
to
the
allusive
use
of
the
charge
in
the
arms
of
the
ancient
family
of
de
la
mere
and
to
its
occurrence
as
one
of
the
badges
adopted
by
the
black
prince
by
his
will
in
the
prince
left
to
his
son
some
hangings
de
worstede
embroidery
avec

the
mermaid
is
found
too
sometimes
on
paving
tiles
bells
and
in
gothic
stone
and
wood
carving
it
may
be
seen
for
example
in
a
boss
at
exeter
cathedral
in
winchester
cathedral
the
mermaid
holds
the
accustomed
comb
while
her
companion

grasps

in
lyons
cathedral
a
mermaid
or
we
may
perhaps
more
justly
say
a
mer
matron
nurses
a
mer
baby
a
mermaid
will
be
found
carved
on
one

established

at

street
cheapside
scoresby
in
his
account
of
the
arctic
regions
says
that
the
head
of
the
young
walrus
is
very
human
in
appearance
the
creature
has
a
way
too
of
rearing
itself
well
out
of
water
to
gaze
at
ships
and
other
objects
in
a
way
that
proves
very
suggestive
of
the
mermaid
idea
i
have
myself
he
remarks
seen
one
in
such
a
position
and
under
such
circumstances
that
it
required
very
little
stretch
of
imagination
to
mistake
it
for
a
human
being
so
like
indeed
was
it
that
the
surgeon
of
the
ship
actually
reported
to
me
his
having
seen
a
man
with
his
head
just
appearing
above
the
water
it
is
probable
that
the
various
species
of
seals
too
are
responsible
for
many
of
the
mermaid
and
triton
stories
as
at
a
little
distance
and
amidst
the
spray
dashing
over
the
rocks
they
are
very
human
looking
at
all
events
perhaps
sufficiently
so
to
satisfy
the
credulity
of
those
whose
superstition
made
them
susceptible
to
such
ideas
on
the
other
hand
a
whaler
or
other
old
salt
who
has
seen
thousands
of
seals
should
scarcely
be
imposed
upon
in
this
way
under
any
possible
circumstances
let
us
turn
however
to
some
of
the
experiences
of
those
who
profess
to
have
seen
the
real
thing
in
the
way
of
mermaids
and
see
what
they
can
tell
us
hudson
the
great
navigator
whose
narrative
is
strikingly
free
from
any
touch
of
imagination
and
may
in
fact
almost
without
fear
of
libel
be
called
dry
and
tedious
tells
us
in
the
following
words
of
a
curious
incident
that
happened
to
them
while
forcing
a
passage
through
the
ice
near
nova
zembla
this
morning
one
of
our
company
looking
overboard
saw
a
mermaid
and
calling
up
some
of
the
company
to
see
her
one
more
came
up
and
by
that
time
she
was
come
close
to
the
ship
s
side
looking
earnestly
on
the
men
a
little
while
after
a
sea
came
and
overturned
her
from
the
navel
upward
her
back
and
breast
were
like
a
woman
s
as
they
say
that
saw
her
her
body
as
big
as
one
of
ours
her
skin
very
white
and
long
hair
hanging
down
behind
of
colour
black
in
her
going
down
they
saw
her
tail
which
was
like
the
tail
of
a
porpoise
and
speckled
like
a
mackerel
their
names
that
saw
her
were
thomas
hilles
and
robert
rayney
whatever
explanation
says
gosse
in
commenting
on
this
story
of
the
old
voyager
in
his
romance
of
natural
history
may
be
attempted
of
this
apparition
the
ordinary
resource
of
seal
and
walrus
will
not
avail
here
seals
and
walruses
must
have
been
as
familiar
to
these
polar
mariners
as
cows
to
a
milkmaid
unless
the
whole
story
was
a
concocted
lie
between
the
two
men
reasonless
and
objectless
and
the
worthy
old
navigator
doubtless
knew
the
character
of
his
men
they
must
have
seen
some
form
of
being
as
yet
unrecognized
in
the
speculum
regale
an
icelandic
work
of
the
twelfth
century
we
read
of
a
creature
that
was
to
be
found
off
the
shores
of
greenland
like
a
woman
as
far
down
as
her
waist
long
hands
and
soft
hair
the
neck
and
head
in
all
respects
like
those
of
a
human
being
the
hands
seem
to
be
long
and
the
fingers
not
to
be
pointed
but
united
into
a
web
like
that
on
the
feet
of
water
birds
from
the
waist
downwards
this
monster
resembles
a
fish
with
scales
tail
and
fins
this
shows
itself
especially
before
heavy
storms
the
habit
of
this
creature
is
to
dive
frequently
and
rise
again
to
the
surface
with
fishes
in
its
hands
when
sailors
see
it
playing
with
the
fish
or
throwing
them
towards
the
ship
they
fear
that
they
are
doomed
to
lose
several
of
the
crew
but
when
it
casts
the
fish
from
the
vessel
then
the
sailors
take
it
as
a
good
omen
that
they
will
not
suffer
loss
in
the
impending
storm
this
monster
has
a
very
horrible
face
with
broad
brow
and
piercing
eyes
a
wide
mouth
and
double
chin
this
is
clearly
a
creature
to
be
dreaded
we
may
in
fact
lay
down
the
broad
principle
that
the
attractive
and
fascinating
mermaid
is
the
creation
of
the
landsman
and
poet
while
the
sterner
type
is
that
of
the
mariner
pontoppidan
in
his
natural
history
of
norway
has
his
mermaid
story
but
it
is
too
long
to
quote
and
it
is
moreover
needless
to
do
so
as
all
these
narratives
follow
much
the
same
general
lines
captain
john
smith
too
in
his
account
of
his
expedition
to
america
in
has
a
similar
experience
to
relate
and
many
narratives
of
like
tenour
might
be
found
in
various
old
writers
but
we
will
now
turn
to
one
or
two
that
not
merely
describe
a
mermaid
and
merman
seen
but
the
creature
actually
captured
the
following
news
item
from
the
scots
magazine
for
the
year
refers
to
a
creature
less
piscine
than
the
typical
form
but
coming
sufficiently
near
it
for
inclusion
they
write
from
vigo
in
spain
that
some
fishermen
lately
took
on
that
coast
a
sort
of
monster
or
merman
five
feet
and
a
half
long
from
its
foot
to
its
head
which
is
like
that
of
a
goat
it
has
a
long
beard
and
moustachios
and
black
skin
somewhat
hairy
a
very
long
neck
short
arms
and
hands
longer
than
they
ought
to
be
in
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
body
long
fingers
like
those
of
a
man
with
nails
like
claws
very
long
toes
joined
like
the
feet
of
a
duck
and
the
heels
furnished
with
fins
resembling
the
winged
feet
with
which
painters
represent
mercury
we
get
considerably
nearer
the
ideal
in
the
seven
mermaids
that
were
said
to
be
entrapped
by
some
fishermen
in
their
nets
off
ceylon
in
the
year
of
these
several
jesuits
and
the
physician
to
the
viceroy
of
goa
professed
to
be
eye
witnesses
and
the
latter
having
dissected
them
with
great
care
asserts
that
both
the
internal
and
external
structure
resembled
that
of
human
beings
of
the
piscine
moiety
he
appears
to
make
no
mention
in
the
speculum
mundi
we
have
a
very
circumstantial
account
indeed
of
a
mermaid
who
drifted
inland
through
a
broken
dyke
on
the
dutch
coast
during
a
heavy
storm
and
floating
up
and
down
and
not
finding
a
passage
out
againe
by
reason
that
the
breach
was
stopped
after
the
flood
was
espied
by
certain
women
and
their
servants
as
they
went
to
milke
their
kine
in
the
neighbouring
pastures
who
at
the
first
were
afraide
of
her
but
seeing
her
often
they
resolved
to
take
her
which
they
did
and
bringing
her
home
she
suffered
herself
to
be
clothed
and
fed
with
bread
and
milk
and
other
meats
and
would
often
strive
to
steal
again
into
the
sea
but
being
carefully
watched
she
could
not
moreover
she
learned
to
spinne
and
perform
other
pettie
offices
of
women
but
at
the
first
they
cleansed
her
of
her
sea
mosse
which
did
sticke
about
her
she
never
spake
but
lived
dumbe
and
continued
alive
fifteene
yeares
then
she
died
they
tooke
her
in
the
yeare
of
our
lord
one
can
scarcely
wonder
at
the
poor
sea
maid
endeavouring
to
escape
the
scraping
down
to
get
off
the
seaweed
and
barnacles
prior
to
the
introduction
to
the
rough
dress
of
a
dutch
peasant
and
the
homely
lessons
in
spinning
bread
making
and
other
domestic
cares
were
a
sad
contrast
to
the
life
of
wild
freedom
of
yore
amidst
the
rolling
billows
of
the
wild
north
sea
we
read
too
that
she
was
taught
to
kneel
before
a
crucifix
a
task
in
itself
we
should
imagine
of
considerable
difficulty
to
a
mermaid
when
we
read
in
another
old
author
that
in
the
island
mauritius
they
eat
of
the
mermaid
its
taste
is
not
unlike
veal
the
last
vestige
of
the
poetry
of
the
belief
vanishes
while
the
added
detail
that
when
they
are
first
taken
they
cry
and
grieve
with
great
sensibility
seems
to
bring
the
indulgence
in
such
diet
almost
to
cannibalism
from
veal
to
the
maiden
clothed
alone
in
loveliness
of
whom
the
poet
sings
is
a
contrast
indeed
and
even
the
scraped
mermaid
turned
dutch
vrouw
is
a
very
different
creature
to
her
whose
golden
hair
fell
o
er
her
shoulders
white
and
curled
in
amorous
ringlets
round
her
breasts
her
eyes
were
melting
into
love
her
lips
had
made
the
very
roses
envious
withal
a
voice
so
full
and
yet
so
clear
so
tender
made
for
loving
dialoges
and
then
she
sang
sang
of
undying
love
that
waited
them
within
her
coral
groves
beneath
the
deep
blue
sea
and
all
the
bliss
that
mortals
made
immortal
could
enjoy
who
lived
with
her
in
sweet
community
in
an
advertisement
in
the
london
daily
post
of
january
rd
we
read
that
there
is
to
be
seen
next
door
to
the
crown
tavern
in
threadneedle
street
behind
the
royal
exchange
at
one
shilling
each
the
surprising
fish
or
maremaid
taken
by
eight
fishermen
on
friday
the
th
of
september
last
at
topsham
bar
near
exeter
and
has
been
shewn
to
several
gentlemen
and
those
of
the
faculty
in
the
cities
of
exeter
bath
and
bristol
who
declare
never
to
have
seen
the
like
so
remarkable
is
this
curiosity
amongst
the
wonders
of
creation
this
uncommon
species
of
nature
represents
from
the
collarbone
down
the
body
what
the
antients
called
a
maremaid
has
a
wing
to
each
shoulder
like
those
of
a
cherubim
mentioned
in
history
with
regular
ribs
breasts
thighs
and
feet
the
joints
thereto
having
their
proper
motions
and
to
each
thigh
a
fin
the
tail
resembles
a
dolphin
s
which
turns
up
to
the
shoulders
the
forepart
of
the
body
very
smooth
but
the
skin
of
the
back
rough
the
back
part
of
the
head
like
a
lyon
has
a
large
mouth
sharp
teeth
two
eyes
spout
holes
nostrils
and
a
thick
neck
this
we
may
not
uncharitably
assume
was
less
a
mermaid
than
a
swindle
while
the
advertisement
tells
us
that
the
creature
in
question
has
been
seen
by
several
of
the
faculty
it
does
not
tell
us
what
the
faculty
said
when
they
saw
it
this
is
a
very
serious
omission
this
maremaid
does
not
altogether
conform
to
the
accepted
type
feet
spout
holes
and
cherubic
wings
being
all
abnormal
developments
there
are
of
course
at
all
times
plenty
of
skilful
knaves
and
unprincipled
adventurers
ready
in
divers
ways
to
take
advantage
of
the
credulity
of
the
public
and
a
belief
in
many
absurdities
has
been
maintained
by
the
apparent
evidence
which
the
conniving
of
such
persons
has
from
time
to
time
furnished
to
say
nothing
of
the
impostures
constantly
practised
at
fairs
and
by
travelling
show
people
it
was
announced
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
century
that
a
party
had
arrived
from
abroad
with
a
mermaid
and
that
it
was
to
be
exhibited
in
one
of
the
leading
streets
in
the
west
end
of
london
a
good
round
fee
was
demanded
for
admission
and
the
dupes
were
shown
a
strange
looking
object
in
a
glass
case
which
was
unblushingly
declared
to
be
a
mermaid
but
the
imposture
was
too
gross
to
last
long
it
was
ascertained
to
be
the
dried
skin
of
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
monkey
attached
to
the
skin
of
a
fish
of
the
salmon
kind
with
the
head
cut
off
the
whole
being
stuffed
and
highly
varnished
this
grotesque
object
was
taken
by
a
dutch
vessel
from
on
board
a
native
malacca
boat
and
from
the
reverence
shown
it
by
the
sailors
it
was
probably
an
idol
or
fetish
the
incarnation
of
some
river
god
of
their
mythology
repulsive
as
the
creature
was
we
have
an
illustration
of
it
before
us
in
a
newspaper
of
the
year
it
achieved
a
great
popularity
and
the
profits
that
accrued
from
the
exhibition
were
for
some
time
considerable
but
the
owners
presently
quarrelled
amongst
themselves
and
the
unpoetic
ending
of
this
monkey
mermaiden
was
that
she
became
the
subject
of
a
suit
in
chancery
when
one
remembers
the
success
that
barnum
achieved
amongst
the
credulous
in
very
much
more
recent
times
with
a
stuffed
mermaid
we
can
only
feel
that
carlyle
was
right
in
his
liberal
percentage
of
fools
and
though
in
this
case
it
was
the
cute
yankee
and
not
the
unsuspecting
britisher
that
succumbed
the
truth
of
southey
s
assertion
that
man
is
a
dupeable
animal
holds
equally
good
and
is
of
far
reaching
application
the
pseudodoxia
epidemica
or
enquiries
into
very
many
received
tenents
and
commonly
presumed
truths
by
thomas
browne
doctor
of
physick
is
a
book
far
in
advance
of
its
time
and
very
interesting
in
showing
what
extraordinary
beliefs
were
held
at
the
time
it
was
written
the
copy
open
before
us
is
the
second
edition
and
is
dated
some
of
the
ideas
combatted
are
that
crystall
is
nothing
else
but
ice
strongly
congealed
the
legend
of
the
wandering
jew
that
a
diamond
is
made
soft
by
the
blood
of
a
goat
that
an
elephant
hath
no
joynts
that
a
salamander
lives
in
the
fire
that
storks
will
only
live
in
republics
to
these
fancies
many
others
might
be
added
and
some
few
of
them
that
deal
with
the
animal
kingdom
we
shall
have
occasion
to
touch
upon
in
the
course
of
our
book
we
naturally
turn
to
browne
s
remarks
upon
mermaids
but
we
scarcely
gather
from
them
any
definite
idea
as
to
his
belief
in
the
matter
before
quoting
his
remarks
we
must
premise
that
his
style
of
composition
is
somewhat
stilted
and
pedantic
few
eyes
saith
he
have
escaped
the
picture
of
mermaids
that
is
according
to
horace
his
monster
with
woman
s
head
above
and
fishing
extremity
below
and
this
is
conceived
to
answer
the
shape
of
the
ancient
syrens
that
attempted
upon
ulysses
which
notwithstanding
were
of
another
description
containing
no
fishy
composure
but
made
up
of
man
and
bird
the
human
mediety
being
variously
placed
not
only
above
but
also
below
these
pieces
so
common
among
us
doe
rather
derive
their
originall
and
are
indeed
the
very
description
of
dagon
which
was
made
with
humane
figure
above
and
fishy
shape
below
of
the
shape
of
atergates
or
derceto
with
the
ph
nicians
in
whose
fishy
and
feminine
mixture
as
some
conceive
were
implied
the
moon
and
the
sun
or
the
deity
of
the
waters
from
whence
were
probably
occasioned
the
pictures
of
nereides
and
tritons
among
the
grecians
browne
had
the
wisdom
at
a
period
when
immense
faith
was
attached
to
tradition
to
investigate
matters
for
himself
whenever
it
was
possible
and
the
courage
to
declare
the
result
whether
it
fell
in
with
the
statements
of
previous
authorities
or
not
thus
he
tells
us
that
the
antipathy
between
a
toad
and
a
spider
and
that
they
poisonously
destroy
each
other
is
very
famous
and
solemne
stories
have
been
written
of
their
combats
wherin
most
commonly
the
victory
is
given
unto
the
spider
this
definite
statement
of
antipathy
would
appear
to
be
an
assertion
very
capable
of
proof
or
disproof
but
it
never
seems
to
have
occurred
to
the
philosophers
to
bring
the
matter
to
test
it
being
so
much
simpler
to
copy
throughout
the
centuries
from
each
other
but
what
we
have
observed
herein
quoth
browne
we
cannot
in
reason
conceale
who
having
in
a
glasse
included
a
toad
with
severall
spiders
we
beheld
the
spiders
without
resistance
to
sit
upon
his
head
and
passe
over

in

observation
collapsed

held
its

him

right
to
speak
out

he
analyses
the
works
of
the
ancients
very
freely

withal
very
justly

temperately
thus
he
terms
dioscorides

author

that

is
a
direct
descendant
from
the
tritons

of
classic
mythology

fancy

that
these
in
turn
may
have
descended
from
the

older
civilizations

of
egypt

assyria
we
can
hardly
ascribe
any
close
association
between
the
chaldean
oannes

the
popular
notion
as
to
mermaids
the
former
is
divine
and
is
necessarily
but
one

the
latter
claim
no
divinity
and
no
individuality

are
both
numerous

nameless
the
work
of
oannes
was
moreover
wholly
beneficent
he
taught
men
the
arts
of
life
to
construct
cities
to
found
temples
to
compile
laws
he
was
a
solar
deity
equivalent
to
osiris
and
apollo
bringing
light
and
life
to
all
he
was
fabled
to
visit
earth
each
morning
and
at
evening
to
plunge
into
the
sea
a
poetic
description
of
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
hence
his
semi
piscine
form
was
an
expression
of
the
belief
that
half
his
time
was
spent
on
earth
and
half
below
the
waves
hence
too
the
moon
goddess
derceto
that
browne

to
as
at
times
manifesting
herself
to
the
eyes
of
men
at
times
plunged
beneath

was
represented
as
half
woman
half
fish
and
may
be
thus
still
seen
on
the
coins
of
ascalon
the
kindly
influence
of
solar
and
lunar
deities
in

words
the

fancies
of

idea

the
changing
of

a
very
ancient
one

tells

affirm
that
the
whole
nation
of
the
neuri
change
themselves
once

wolves

metamorphoses
tells
how
zeus
visited
lykaon
the
king
of
arcadia
and
how
the
king
placed
a
dish
of
roasted
human
flesh
before
his
guest
to
test
his
omniscience
the
daring
experiment
was
promptly
detected
and
the
monarch
as
a
punishment
was
changed
into
a
wolf
by
the
offended
deity
in
order
that
henceforth
he
should
himself
feed
on
the
flesh
he
had
so
impiously
offered
in
vain
he
attempted
to
speak
from
that
very
instant
his
jaws
were
bespluttered
with
foam
and
only
he
thirsted
for
blood

he
ranged
amongst
flocks

for
slaughter

the
picture

fury
euanthes
an
early
greek
writer
tells
a
very
circumstantial
story
indeed
of
a
certain
tribe
where
one
of
its
members
must
each
year
be
chosen
by
lot
to
become
a
wolf
why
this
should
be
at
all
necessary

does
not
stop
to
explain

conditions
are
very
precise

day
and
the
man
having
been
selected
he
is
taken
to
the
border
of
a
large
lake
and
his
clothes
removed
and
hung
upon
an
oak
tree
he
then
swims
across
the
lake
and
disappears
into
the
gloomy
woods
that
come
down
on
the
further
side
to
the
water
s
edge
and
then
and
there
changes
into
a
wolf
should
he
forbear
for
nine
years
to
eat
the
flesh
of
man
he
may
return
to
the
lake
and
recross
it
changing
back
as
he
lands
into
his
manhood
again
and
only
differing
from
his
former
self
in
the
fact
that
he
will
look
nine
years
older
should
he
on
the
general
principle
of
doing
at
rome
as
the
romans
do
share
with
his
vulpine
companions
in
any
feast
of
human
flesh
a
wolf
he
must
remain
to
the
end
of
his
days
as
very
probably
however
he
would
find
amongst
his
comrades
some
few
who
like
himself
were
human
beings
undergoing
this
temporary
metamorphosis
he
would
be
encouraged
to
persevere
in
this
restriction
of
his
diet
by
their
example
and
encouragement
and
also
escape
the
painful
singularity
that
his
genuinely
wolf
associates
would
very
possibly
resent
one
fabius
having
an
inquiring
mind
and
fired
with
curiosity
as
to
why
the
man
should
carefully
suspend
his
clothes
in
an
oak
tree
is
able
to
add
as
the
result
of
his
inquiries
that
those
are
the
clothes
that
the
man
resumes
when
he
emerges
from
the
lake
whether
they
had
been
miraculously
preserved
or
whether
they
had
undergone
such
deterioration
as
would
otherwise
arise
from
their
suspension
in
a
tree
exposed
to
all
weathers

nine
years

not
inform
us
the
point
is
a
distinctly
interesting
one
and
especially
to
the
man
reclaiming
his
wardrobe
one
great
feature
of
terror
in
the
belief
in
lycanthropy
and
such
like
metamorphosis
is
that
the
man
still
retains
his
human
reason
memory
and
knowledge
of
himself
and
his
surroundings
and
is
in
addition
imbued
with
the
fierce
animal
instincts
of
the
ravenous
brute
into
which
he
has
been
transformed
the
wolf
is
the
prominent
animal
in
the
history
of
this
belief
in
europe
since
in
this
part
of
the
world
it
was
the
creature
that
caused
the

devastation

wicked
men

in
the
new

for
their

in
the
ravings

utter
things
that
superstition
could
readily
distort

is
by

outrageous

retreating
into

and
foaming
in

lust

many
helpless
men
women

children
were
destroyed

them

frightful
epidemic

some
commentators

held
that
nebuchadnezzar
when
driven
from
the
presence
of
man
was
suffering
from
a
like
form
of
madness
and
fancying
himself
to
be
a
beast
it
was
a
common
belief
in
ancient
times
that
the
wehr
wolf
simply
effected
the
change
from
man
to
beast
by
turning
his
skin
inside
out
hence
he
was
sometimes
called
versipellis
a
term
equivalent
to
skin
turner
in
medi
val
days
it
was
thought
that
the
wolf
s
skin
was
beneath
the
human
and
any
unfortunate
individual
who
was
suspected
of
lycanthropy
was
very
likely
to
find
himself
being
hacked
at
by
seekers
after
truth
in
search
of
this
inner
hairy
covering
olaus
magnus
in
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
tells
us
a
story
of
a
nobleman
and
his
retinue
who
lost
their
way
in
journeying
through
a
wild
forest
and
presently
found
themselves
hopelessly
foodless
and
shelterless
in
the
urgency
of
their
need
one
of
his
servants
disclosed
to
him
in
confidence
that
he
had
the
power
of
turning
himself
at
will
into
a
wolf
and
doubted
not
but
that
if
his
master
would
kindly
excuse
him
awhile
he
would
be
able
to
find
the
party
some
provision
permission
being
given
the
man
disappeared
into
the
forest
under
semblance
of
a
wolf
and
very
quickly
returned
with
a
lamb
in
his
mouth
and
then
having
fulfilled
his
mission
resumed
his
human
shape
the
forest
would
provide
unlimited
fuel
while
their
knives
would
supply
the
cutlery
some
member
of
the
party
it
is
to
be
hoped
had
a
tinder
box
or
the
repast
after
all
would
have
to
consist
of
cold
raw
lamb
as
hunger
is
proverbially
said
to
be
the
best
sauce
the
absence
of
mint
would
be
of
little
moment
at
this
vulpine
banquet
the
belief
in
man
s
power
thus
to
change
his
form
and
nature
is
obviously
derived
from
the
widely
spread
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
the
passing
of
the
soul
after
the
human
life
is
ended
into
an
animal
or
a
series
of
animals
this
change
is
ordinarily
in
harmony
with
the
character
of

john
of
nuremberg
relates
in
his
book
de
miraculis
how
a
man
lost
at
night
in
a
strange
country
directed
his
steps
towards
a
fire
that
he
saw
before
him
on
reaching
it
he
found
a
wolf
sitting
enjoying
its
warmth
and
was
informed
by
him
that
he
was
really
as
human
as
himself
but
that
he
was
compelled
for
a
certain
number
of
years
like
all
his
countrymen
to
assume
the
shape
of
a
wolf
a
strange
country
indeed
where
wolves
when
the
evenings
grow
chilly
light
a
fire
and
in
the
comfort
of
its
ruddy
glow
are
found
quite
ready
to
entertain
the
passing
traveller
with
their
conversation
in
the
year
one
garnier
a
native
of
lyons
who
had
led
a
very
secluded
life
excited
the
suspicions
of
his
neighbours
and
was
dragged
before
the
tribunals
on
the
charge
of
being
a
loup
garou
the
french
equivalent
term
for
wehr
wolf
it
was
affirmed
that
he
prowled
about
at
night
and
in
vulpine
form
devoured
infants
he
was
arrested
and
put
to
the
torture
confessed
everything
that
was
charged
against
him
and
was
burnt
at
the
stake
it
was
no
joke
in
medi
val
days
to
be
a
little
retiring
in
disposition
the
worst
construction
was
put
upon
it
and
one
s
neighbours
at
short
notice
were
able
to
report
having
seen
a
black
cat
about
the
place
or
some
equally
convincing
proof
of
evil
possession
and
from
thence
it
was
a
short
passage
to
the
river
or
the
fire
within
a
few
years
afterwards
a
man
named
roulet
was
tried
at
angers
on
the
charge
of
having
slain
and
partially
devoured
a
boy
evidence
was
given
that
he
was
seen
in
wolf
form
tearing
the
body
and
on
being
pursued
he
took
refuge
in
a
thicket
here
he
was
surrounded
and
captured
but
when
caught
he
had
resumed
the
human
form
he
was
condemned
to
death
but
the
sentence
was
afterwards
changed
to
life
long
confinement
in
auvergne
in
a
nobleman
in
returning
from
the
chase
was
stopped
by
a
stranger
who
told
him
that
he
had
been
furiously
attacked
by
a
savage
wolf
but
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
save
himself
by
slashing
off
one
of
its
fore
paws
this
he
produced
as
a
trophy
when
to
the
astonishment
of
both
it
was
found
to
have
become
the
delicate
hand
of
a
lady
the
noble
felt
so
sure
that
he
recognized
a
ring
upon
it
that
he
hurried
to
the
castle
and
there
found
his
wife
sitting
with
her
arm
tied
up
and
on
removing
the
wrappers
the
hand
was
missing
she
had
to
stand
her
trial
as
a
loup
garou
and
being
convicted
perished
at
the
stake
stories
of
the
type
of
those
given
might
readily
be
multiplied
indefinitely
a
belief
in
enchantment
introduced
a
new
complication
things
we
are
taught
are
not
always
what
they
seem
and
certainly
in
the
writings
of
the
middle
ages
we
find
many
illustrations
of
the
truth
of
this
adage
since
the
pages
of
those
authors
abound
with
examples
of
the
transformation
of
men
and
women
into
various
uncanny
creatures
by
mystic
spells
the
story
of
beauty
and
the
beast
is
a
survival
of
these
sir
john
maundevile
to
give
but
one
illustration
tells
us
in
his
very
wonderful
travels
of
a
dragon
that
was
to
be
seen
in
the
island
of
cos
a
creature
which
the
people
of
the
island
called
the
lady
of
the
land
being
in
fact
the
doughtre
of
ypocras
in
forme
and
lykenesse
of
a
gret
dragoun
that
is
an
hundred

this
deane

may
perhaps
scarcely
recognize
as

how
it
was

between
them
brought
about
such
a
state
of
things
the
history
does
not
tell
us
centuries
after
deane
was
an
exploded
myth
we
find
this
evidence
of
a
by
gone
feud
still
in
existence
testifying
to
the
virulence
of
the
goddess
s
temper
and
the
power

this
for
he
wente
out
of
a

was
a
stranger

to

there
found
a

in

she
asked
him
if
he
were
a

that
he

she
told

that
she

and
that
if
he
would
free
her
from
this
he
should
be
her
lord
and
have
in
addition
much
treasure
how
his
felowes
in
the
schippe
were
able
to

him
knight

not
appear
but
he
at
all
events
presented
himself
on

for
to

him
at

entirely
failed

at

critical

illustration
fig
a
belief
in
witches
fairies
and
divers
other
uncanny
folk
was
a
strong
article
of
faith
with
our
ancestors
but
to
go
at
any
just
length
into
these
points
would
lead
us
further
afield
than
our
title
would
perhaps
justify
as
we
have
already
referred
to
the
suspicion
that
attached
itself
to
anyone
who
led
a
life
somewhat
outside
the
ordinary
groove
we
append
an
excellent
illustrative
passage
from
spenser
s
faerie
queene
as
it
admirably
conveys
the
popular
idea
there
in
a
gloomy
hollow
glen
she
found
a
little
cottage
built
of
sticks
and
reedes
in
homely
wise
and
walled
with
sod
around
in
which
a
witch
did
dwell
in
loathly
weedes
and
wilful
want
all
careless
of
her
needes
so
choosing
solitarie
to
abide
far
from
all
neighbours
that
her
devilish
deedes
and
hellish
arts
from
people
she
might
hide
and
hurt
far
off
unknowne
whom
ever
she
envide
those
who
care
to
look
the
subject
up
may
turn
to
reginald
scot
s
discoverie
of
witchcraft
wherein
the
lewde
dealing
of
witches
and
witchmongers
is
notablie
detected
the
knauerie
of
coniurors
the
curiositie
of
figure
casters
and
many
other
things
are
opened
which
have
long
lien
hidden
or
perhaps
better
still
to
the
book
entitled
saducismus
triumphatus
or
full
and
plain
evidence
concerning
witches
and
apparitions
proving
partly
by
holy
scripture
partly
by
a
choice
collection
of
modern
relations
the
real
existence
of
apparitions
spirits
and
witches
by
jos
glanvil
late
chaplain
to
his
majesty
and
fellow
of
the
royal
society
the
copy
before
us
is
dated
and
is
full
of
tales
of
familiar
spirits
in
the
forms
of
toads
rabbits
hares
dogs
c
diver
incantations
to
provoke
evil
or
to
shield
from
it
and
the
like
all
gravely
narrated
the
author
in
fact
holds
it
rank
atheism
to
doubt
such
tales
since
witches
are
moved
by
evil
spirits
and
if
people
do
not
believe
in
one
they
do
not
in
the
other
and
therefore
not
in
spirits
at
all
and
therefore
not
in
god
in
the
days
of
our
forefathers
the
ideas
held
were
of
a
very
primitive
and
unscientific
character
and
what
knowledge
there
was
was
largely
mixed
up
with
mysticism
gross
superstition
rank
credulity
sheer
guesswork
the
common
people
saw
in
everything
outside
their
common
experience
some
grave
portent
some
prophecy
of
coming
evil
and
filled
the
forest
glades
the
wild
moorland
the
dark
recesses
of
the
mine
the
air
the
waters
with
strange
forms
of
life
sometimes
in
sympathy
with
mankind
but
more
frequently
hostile
we
may
on
the
whole
be
very
thankful
that
our
lot
was
not
cast
in
the
good
old
times

humanity
we
propose
now
to
give
some
little
consideration
to
the
ideas
that
have
clustered
round
various
animals
dealing
first
with
the
beasts
the
royal
lion
the
elephant
and
various
others
then
passing
through
the
various
stages
of
birds
fishes
and
reptiles
to
the
conclusion
of
our
labours
the
lion
claims
our
first
regard
since
he
has
by
the
naturalists
poets
moralists
fable
writers
been
unanimously
crowned
the
king
of
beasts
and
has
been
duly
accredited
with
every
royal
virtue
such
as
magnanimity
courage
generosity
while
in
art
he
has
always
taken
the
same
exalted
position
crowning
the
gates
of
mycen
flanking
the
entrances
of
the
palaces
of
nineveh
enhancing
the
dignity
of
the
pharaohs
guarding
the
steps
of
the
throne
of
solomon
typifying
in
the
lion
of
lucerne
undaunted
bravery
and
around
the
column
of
nelson
in
trafalgar
square
or
on
the
royal
standard
of
england
symbolising
all
that
britons
associate
with
the
grandeur
and
might
of
their
country
the
lion
alone
of
all
wild
beasts
we
are
told
is
gentle
to
those
that
humble
themselves
to
him
and
even
when
his
wrath
is
awakened
and
the
pangs
of
hunger
call
for
relief
his
chivalrous
nature
is
such
that
he
will
not
attack
a
woman
without
the
greatest
provocation
or
necessity
another
interesting
fact
that
the
ancient
writers
ascertained
is
that
the
blood
of
the
lion
is
black
that
he
is
not
in
any
derogatory
sense
black
hearted
is
one
of
the
most
heartily
accepted
articles
of
belief
since
the
magnanimity
of
the
lion
is
the
trait
in
his
character
that
is
most
fully
dwelt
upon
there
have
nevertheless
arisen
unbelievers
in
these
latter
days
who
have
endeavoured
to
belittle
the
royal
beast
and
to
make
out
that
he
is
after
all
not
much
better
than
a
sneaking
coward
that
his
courage
springs
from
a
knowledge
of
his
superior
power
and
that
his
forbearance
and
generosity
are
but
indications
that
the
creature
at
the
time
he
displayed
these
estimable
qualities
had
lately
dined
even
in
the
following
passage
from
an
early
writer
we
get
some
little
hint
of
this
feeling
he
despiseth
the
darts
and
defendeth
himself
by
his
terror
only
and
as
if
bearing
witness
that
he
is
forced
to
his
own
defence
he
riseth
up
in
fury
not
as
at
last
compelled
by
the
peril
but
is
made
angry
by
their
folly
but
this
more
noble
display
of
courage
is
shown
in
that
however
great
may
be
the
strength
of
hounds
and
hunters
while
in
the
open
plains
and
where
he
may
be
seen
he
retireth
only
by
degrees
and
with
scorn
but
when
he
hath
got
amongst
the
thickets
and
woods
then
he
hurrieth
away
as
if
the
place
concealed
his
shame
perhaps
however
we
should
assign
this
strategic
movement
to
the
rear
to
the
discretion
that
we
are
proverbially
told
is
such
an
excellent
supplement
to
mere
valour
or
a
wise
acquiescence
in
the
dictum
he
that
fights
and
runs
away
will
live
to
fight
another
day
the
ideal
lion
however
is
a
very
noble
beast
indeed
and
very
few
of
the
early
writers
do
aught
but
sing
his
praises
aldrovandus
in
his
book
on
animals
not
the
monstrorum
historia
but
the
volume
that
treats
of
matter
of
fact
creatures
deals
very
fully
with
his
subject
the
lion
stands
first
and
our
readers
will
gather
some
notion
of
the
fulness
of
the
treatment
when
we
state
that
the
royal
beast
takes
up
sixty
three
folio
pages
the
book
is
written
wholly
in
latin
and
the
various
details
are
arranged
in
sections
amongst
these
we
find
descriptio
anatomica

even
this
does
not
exhaust
the
exceedingly
comprehensive
treatment
though
amply
sufficient
to
illustrate
it
the
leopard
lynx
dog
and
other
beasts
are
in
proportion
as
fully
treated
of
though
the
subjects
of
the
sections
of
course
vary
thus
in
the
dog
we
find
much
information
under
the
heading
fidelitas
and

sections
that
would
be
entirely
out
of
place
in
the
description
of
the
wolf
the
aldrovandus
picture
of
the
lion
is
rather
a
poor
one
while
the
tiger
is
very
fairly
good
and
the
wolf
is
capital
it
is
rather
curious
too
that
the
hippopotamus
the
first
living
specimen
of
which
as
far
as
we
know
came
to
europe
over
two
hundred
years
after
the
publication
of
the
book
in
question
is
represented
by
very
fair
figures
by
which
it
can
readily
be
identified
there
are
three
of
these
altogether
and
one
of
them
has
seized
a
crocodile
by
the
tail
several
of
the
beasts
are
also
given
in
skeleton
form
thus
we
have
the
osteology
of
the
wolf
squirrel
mole
and
many
others
carefully
rendered
the
effect
is
sometimes
rather
quaint
thus
for
instance
the
skeleton
of
the
hare
is
given
and
the
creature
in
this
osseous
condition
is
represented
as
gnawing
a
plant
the
mole
is
figured
with
very
conspicuous
eyes
any
plant
that
can
be
at
all
associated
with
an
animal
is
always
introduced
thus
we
have
a
very
good
drawing
of
the
rabbit
nibbling
clover
and
the
legend
appended
cuniculus
cinereus
cum
trifolio
pratensi
quo
maxime
delectatus
a
statement
that
many
a
luckless
farmer
would
very
heartily
endorse
then
we
have
the
weasel
standing
by
a
plant
of
rue
and
the
legend
qua
omnes
mustel
adversus
serpentes
se
defendunt
in
allusion
to
the
old
belief
that
a
weasel
well
fortified
with
rue
was
able
to
wage
successful
war
against
venomous
serpents
many
kinds
of
dogs
are
shown
the
greyhound
the
water
spaniel
the
poodle
with
his
collar
and
so
forth
one
to
show
his
fidelity
to
his
master
carries
two
keys
in
his
mouth
while
another
is
termed
canis
bellicosus
and
certainly
looks
the
character
the
lyon
says
ferne
in
his
blazon
of
gentrie
is
the
most
worthiest
of
all
beastes
yea
he
standeth
as
the
king
and
is
feared
above
all
the
beastes
of
the
fielde
so
that
by
the
lyon
is
signified
principallitie
dominion
and
rule
fortitude
and
magnanimity
is
denoted
in
the
lyon
coats
another
heraldic
authority
of
somewhat
later
date
affirms
that
the
lion
is
the
most
magnanimous
the
most
generous
the
most
bold
and
fierce
of
all
the
four
footed
race
and
therefore
he
has
been
chosen
to
represent
the
greatest
heroes
this
noble
creature
represents
also
command
and
monarchical
dominion
as
likewise
the
magnanimity
of
majesty
at
once
exercising
awe
and
clemency
subduing
those
that
resist
and
sparing
those
that
humble

guillim
in
his
display
of
heraldry
a
most
popular
book
running
through
many
editions
scarcely
gives
so
exalted
an
idea
of
the
king
of
beasts
since
he
tells
us
that
the
lion
when
he
mindeth
to
assail
his
enemy
stirreth
up
himself
by
often
beating
of
his
back
and
sides
with
his
tail
and
thereby
stirreth
up
his
courage
to
the
end
to
do
nothing
faintly
or
cowardly
the
lion
when
he
is
hunted
carefully
provideth
for
his
safety
labouring
to
frustrate
the
pursuit
of
the
hunters
by
sweeping
out
his
footsteps
with
his
tail
as
he
goeth
that
no
appearance
of
his
track
may
be
discovered
when
he
hunteth
after
his
prey
he
roareth
vehemently
whereat
the
beasts
being
astonished
do
make
a
stand
while
he
with
his
tail
makes
a
circuit
around
them
in
the
sand
which
circle
they
dare
not
transgress
which
done
out
of
them
he
maketh
choice
of
prey
at
his
leisure
thus
the
lion
s
tail
is
at
once
a
stimulus
to
valour
an
aid
to
concealment
when
the
valour
has
oozed
away

of

a
book
originally
published
in
and
so
popular
that
within
half
a
century
five
editions
were
called
for
tells
us
that
when
lions
are
born
they
sleepe
continually
three
long
egyptian
daies
whereat
the
lyonesse
making
such
terrible
roring
as

writeth
that
in

and
beareth
in

then
he
is
in

force
in
nothing
so
much
appeareth

of
the
haughtie

as
in
this
that
where
other
beastes
do
herd
and
rowte
together
the
lyon
will
not
do

neither
will
hee
haue
any
soueraigne
such
is
the
haughtie
courage
of
his
high
stomache
that
he
accomteth
himselfe
without
peere
when
he
is
sicke
he
healeth
himselfe
with
the
bloud

when
his

faileth

he
becommeth

as
from
a
flint

therefore
in
the
olde
time
they
made
shields
for
horsemen
of
lyon
s
bones
another
old
writer
tells
us
that
the
lion
is
never
sick
but
of
loathing
this
we
may
presume
is
a
kind
of
biliousness
or
sick
headache
and
a
general
disinclination
for
food
whatever
it
may
be
the
faculty
are
equal
to
the
occasion
as
the
simple
way
to
cure
him
is
to
tie
to
him
the
apes
which
with
their
wanton
mocking
drive
him
to
madness
and
then
when
he
hath
tasted
their
blood
it
acts
as
a
remedy
legh
s
remedy
and
this
one
do
not
quite
agree
but
this
latter
is
clearly
intended
for
the
lion
in
a
state
of
captivity
when
his
unnatural
surroundings
necessitate
severer
treatment
when
a
lion
is
wounded
we
are
told
that
he
has
a
remarkable
quickness
of
observation
in
detecting
which
amongst
the
hunters
is
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
injury
and
no
matter
what
the
size
of
the
hunting
party
he
singles
out
this
particular
individual
for
his
attack
but
if
a
man
has
merely
thrown
a
dart
at
him
without
wounding
him
it
is
sufficient
punishment
for
his
audacity
to
be
struck
down
and
well
shaken
lions
pliny
tells
us
are
destitute
of
craft
and
suspicion
they
never
look
aslant
and
they
love
not
to
be
looked
at
in
that
manner
the
lion
was
believed
by
the
ancients
to
be
afraid
at
the
turning
of
a
wheel
and
more
especially
at
the
crowing
of
a
cock
these
ancient
naturalists
had
excellent
opportunities
of
studying
the
lion
for
one
thing
he
was
found
in
greece
palestine
and
many
other
districts
where
he
is
now
never
seen
and
then
too
the
sports
and
combats
of
the
amphitheatre
and
the
desire
of
the
rulers
to
gain
popularity
by
pleasing
the
multitude
with
various
shows
led
to
their
free
introduction
thus
we
read
that
pompey
the
great
caused
six
hundred
lions
to
be
exhibited
together
to
the
roman
people
while
c
sar
the
dictator
exhibited
four
hundred
and
many
others
in
authority
had
smaller
collections
gathered
together
for
the
gratification
of
the
populace
that
there
were
maneless
lions
was
a
fact
known
to
the
ancient
writers
as
they
are
mentioned
by
pliny
aristotle
and
others
but
the
reason
they
give
for
this
peculiarity
that
they
had
panthers
as
their
sires
is
erroneous
the
lions
found
in
persia
and
arabia
are
almost
maneless
and
the
lions
of
gujerat
have
simply
on
the
middle
line
of
the
back
of
the
neck
some
hairs
that
stand
erect
like
the
mane
of
a
quagga
it
would
probably
be
one
or
both
of
these
varieties
that
had
come
under
the
notice
of
the
ancient
authors
amongst
other
mixed
breeds
that
these
writers
believed
in
was
the
camelopardilis
the
reputed
offspring
of
the
camel
and
the
leopard
or
panther
and
the
hartebeest
springing
from
the
union
of
the
antelope
and
the
buffalo
in
the
livre
des
creatures
the
quaint
old
ms
of
philip
de
thaun
the
lion
is
treated
symbolically
and
as
this
tone
of
thought
greatly
influenced
the
art
and
literature
of
the
period
we
may
very
legitimately
quote
the
passage
the
lion
writes
our
old
author
in
many
ways
rules
over
many
beasts
therefore
is
the
lion
king
he
has
a
frightful
face
the
neck
great
and
hairy
he
has
the
breast
before
square
hardy
and
pugnacious
his
shape
behind
is
slender
his
tail
of
large
fashion
and
he
has
flat
legs
and
haired
down
to
the
feet
he
has
the
feet
large
and
cloven
the
claws
long
and
curved
when
he
is
hungry
or
ill
disposed
he
devours
animals
without
discrimination
as
he
does
the
ass
which
resists
and
brays
now
hear
without
doubt
the
significance
of
this
the
lion
signifies
the
son
of
mary
he
is
king
of
all
people
without
any
gainsay
he
is
powerful
by
nature
over
every
creature
and
fierce
in
appearance
and
with
fierce
look
he
will
appear
to
the
jews
when
he
shall
judge
them
the
square
breast
shows
strength
of
the
deity
the
shape
which
he
has
behind
of
very
slender
make
shows
humanity
which
he
had
with
the
deity
by
the
foot
which
is
cloven
is
demonstrance
of
god
who
will
clasp
the
world
and
hold
it
in
his
fist
it
is
needless
to
follow
de
thaun
any
further
in
his
laboured
mysticism
the
passage
quoted
suffices
to
show
the
method
adopted
the
idea
that
the
lion
s
cubs
were
brought
to
life
three
days
after
their
birth
was
a
belief
that
very
readily
became
transformed
into
a
symbolism
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
from
the
sleep
of
death
while
the
notion
that
the
lion
always
slept
with
its
eyes
open
made
it
a
symbol
of
watchfulness
and
led
to
its
introduction
in
the
sculptures
of
early
christian
churches
and
especially
those
under
lombard
influence
where
it
is
not
infrequently
found
as
a
sentinel
at
the
doors
as
the
base
to
pillars
or
at
the
foot
of
the
pulpits
illustration
fig
according
to
burton
in
his
miracles
of
art
and
nature
in
barbary
tis
said
they
have
lyons
so
tame
that
they
will
gather
up
bones
in
the
street
like
dogs
without
hurting
any
body
and
other
lyons
that
are
of
so
cowardly
a
nature
that
they
will
run
away
at
the
voice
of
the
least
child
munster
s
notion
of
the
african
lion
fig
is
impressive
though
it
is
perhaps
less
nearly
allied
to
the
lion
of
real
life
than
to
the
lion
of
the
herald
of
which
fig
from
the
effigy
of
prince
john
of
eltham
brother
of
edward
iii
in
westminster
abbey
may
be
taken
as
a
characteristic
example
munster
s
lion
would
satisfy
even
the
country
heraldic
painter
who
was
so
irate
when
shown
a
lion
in
a
travelling
menagerie
what
cried
he
tell
me
that
s
a
lion
why
i
ve
painted
lions
rampant
lions
passant
and
all
soils
of
lions
these
five
and
twenty
years
and
for
sure
i
ought
to
know
what
a
lion
is
like
better
than
that
this
lion
of
munster
is
a
very
different
beast
to
the
degenerate
lions
of
barbary
that
find
a
precarious
sustenance
in
collecting
discarded
bones
from
the
gutter
and
slink
away
at
the
chiding
of
some
arab
brat
who
is
inclined
to
break
in
upon
their
sordid
repast
illustration
fig
nature
when
not
interfered
with
by
man
ever
keeps
the
balance
true
hence
the
leontophonos
is
only
bred
where
lions
are
found
and
if
the
old
writers
may
be
trusted
and
there
is
much
virtue
in
an
if
we
have
in
this
an
excellent
antidote
to
the
bane
that
a
plague
of
lions
would
undoubtedly
be
the
king
of
beasts
we
are
told
regards
the
leontophonos
with
deadly
hatred
and
crushes
the
life
out
of
it
with
its
paw
as
the
smallest
portion
of
its
flesh
is
immediate
death
to
him
to
checkmate
this
decisive
action
of
the
lion
we
learn
from
our
ancient
author
that
in
districts
that
have
a
plague
of
lions
the
people
of
the
place
burn
the
leontophonos
and
sprinkle
the
ashes
on
other
pieces
of
flesh
and
these
they
lay
about
as
a
bait
with
fatal
effect
by
this
happy
arrangement
they
are
free
at
once
of
leo
and
leontophonos
one
of
the
greatest
enemies
of
the
lion
would
appear
to
be
the
unicorn
for
though
the
two
appear
to
get
on
amicably
enough
as
supporters
of
the
royal
arms
appearances
it
is
well
known
are
often
deceptive
and
they
are
really
deadly
foes
gesner
in
his
history
of
animals
gives
the
whole
story
in
a
nutshell
for
he
tells
us
that
the
unicorn
and
the
lion
being
enemies
by
nature
as
soon
as
the
lion
sees
the
unicorn
he
betakes
himself
to
a
tree
this
strikes
one
as
being
a
rather
feeble
performance
on
the
part
of
the
king
of
beasts
in
fact
decidedly
infra
dig
but
the
end
is
considered
to
justify
the
means
for
the
unicorn
in
his
fury
and
with
all
the
swiftness
of
his
course
running
at
him
sticks
his
horn
fast
in
the
tree
and
then
the
lion
falls
upon
him
and
kills
him
the
indiscreet
valour
of
the
unicorn
seems
distinctly
a
nobler
thing
than
the
calculating
craft
of
the
lion
spenser
in
the
faerie
queene
introduces
the
story
as
evidently
a
well
known
fact
in
natural
history
like
as
a
lyon
whose
imperial
powre
a
proud
rebellious
unicorn
defyes
t
avoid
the
rash
assault
and
wrathful
stowre
of
his
fiers
foe
him
to
a
tree
applyes
and
when
him
ronning
in
full
course
he
spyes
he
slips
aside
the
whiles
that
furious
beast
his
precious
horne
sought
of
his
enemyes

in
the
stocke

thence
can
be

writes
wert
thou
the
unicorn
pride
and
wrath
would
confound
thee
and
make
thine
own
self
the
conquest
of
thy
fury
and
in
julius
c
sar
we
find
the
line
unicorns
may
be
betray
d
with

both
passages
evidently
referring
to
this
legend
most
furious
of
all
beasts
was
the
monoceros
or
as
lian
calls
it
the
cartazonos
a
creature
still
having
literary
and
heraldic
existence
as
the
unicorn
though
in
some
few
points
the
beast
as
described
by
pliny
and
others
does
not
altogether
resemble
in
form
the
creature
of
the
heralds
that
is
so
well
known
to
us
as
joint
supporter
with
the
lion
of
our
national
arms
the
ancient
monoceros
had
the
body
of
a
horse
the
head
of
a
stag
the
feet
of
an
elephant
and
the
tail
of
a
boar
and
from
the
middle
of
his
forehead
projected

the

picture
of

unicorn

beast
in
all
respects
like
a
horse
save
that
it
has
one
tremendous
horn
barrow
in
his
travels
in
southern
africa
gives
the
figure
of
a
head
of
a
unicorn
which
he
saw
drawn
on
the
side
of
a
cavern
and
appears
to
entertain
no
doubt
that
such
an
animal
exists
while
burton
tells
us
that
in
thiopia
some
kine
there
are
which
have
horns
like
stags
others
but
one
horn
only
and
that
in
the
forehead
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
but
bending
backwards
a
departure
this
from
the
recognized
type
figures
of
the
unicorn
are
found
on
the
archaic
cylinder
seals
of
assyria
and
babylonia
and
throughout
the
whole
course
of
ancient
and
medi
val
history
we
find
belief
in
the
creature
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
belief
in
horse
or
elephant
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
bring
forward
a
score
or
more
of
authors
who
have
written
even
in
comparatively
recent
times
on
the
existence
of
the
unicorn
in
a
curious
old
book
on
our
shelf
the
philosophical
grammar
of
benjamin
martin
published
in
the
author
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
such
creatures
as
the
ph
nix
syrens
dragons
mermaids
fairies
and
many
others
that
he
mentions
really
exist
and
in
the
matter
of
the
unicorn
he
evidently
suspends
judgment
most
naturalists
he
says
have
affirmed
that
there
have
been
such
creatures
and
give
descriptions
of
them
but
the
sight
of
the
creatures
or
credible
relations
of
them
having
been
so
rare
has
occasioned
many
to
believe
there
never
were
any
such
animals
in
nature
at
least
it
has
made
the
history
of
them
very
doubtful
in
all
such
ambiguous
pieces
of
history
tis
better
not
to
be
positive
and
sometimes
to
suspend
our
belief
rather
than
credulously
embrace
every
current
report
in
another
book
however
published
in
and
therefore
not
much
more
than
a
century
ago
the
unicorn
is
described
in
all
sober
seriousness
as
having
equine
body
a
voice
like
the
lowing
of
an
ox
and
his
horn
as
hard
as
iron
and
as
rough
as
any
file
to
the
touch
guillim
declares
that
the
unicorn
cannot
be
taken
alive
the
greatness
of
his
mind
is
such
that
he
chuseth
rather
to
die
while
de
thaun
gives
full
directions
for
its
capture
it
would
appear
that
the
animal
is
of
a
particularly
impressionable
nature
and
is
always
prepared
to
pay
homage
to
maiden
beauty
and
innocence
hence
fierce
as
it
is
the
wily
hunter
by
taking
advantage
of
this
amiable
trait
in
its
character
effects
its
capture
for
when
a
man
intends
to
hunt
and
ensnare
it
he
goes
to
the
forest
where
is
its
repair
and
there
places
a
virgin
then
it
comes
to
the
virgin
falls
asleep
on
her
lap
and
so
comes
to
its
death
the
man
arrives
immediately
and
kills
it
in
its
sleep
or
takes
it
alive
and
does
as
he
will
with
it
as
this
must
be
rather
a
trying
experience
for
the
young
lady
the
indian
and
ethiopians
says
a
later
writer
catch
of
these
unicornes
which
be
in
their
country
after
the
following
manner
they
take
a
goodly
strong
and
beautifull
young
man
whom
they
clothe
in
the
apparell
of
a
woman
besetting
him
with
divers
flowers
and
odoriferous
spices
setting
him
where
the
unicornes
use
to
come
and
when
they
see
this
young
man
they
come
very
lovingly
and
lay
their
heads
down
in
his
lap
for
above
all
creatures
they
do
great
reverence
to
young
maids
and
then
the
hunters
having
notice
given
them
suddenly
come
and
finding
him
asleep
they
will
deal
so
with
him
as
that
before
he
goeth
he
must
leave
his
horn
behind
him
and
fall
a
victim
to
his
guileful
foes
spenser
speaks
of
the
maiden
unicorne
and
dallaway
too
refers
to
their
inviolable
attachment
to
virginity
and
many
other
writers
speak
in
the
same
sense
or
shall
we
rather
say
lack
of
it
the
horn
was
in
great
demand
as
it
was
made
into
drinking
vessels
that
were
held
to
possess
the
invaluable
gift
of
detecting
poison
thus
in
the
speculum
mundi
we
read
of
it
that
it
hath
many
soveraigne
virtues
insomuch
that
being
put
upon
a
table
furnished
with
many
junkets
and
banqueting
dishes
it
will
quickly
descrie
whether
there
be
any
poyson
or
venime
among
them
for
if
there
be
the
horne
is
presently
covered
with
a
kinde
of
sweat
or
dew
this
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
the
horn
of
the
unicorn
as
a
test
for
poisons
is
seen
by
the
frequent
appearance
of
it
in
medi
val
inventories
we
gather
from
these
no
clue
no
alternative
name
for
instance
to
guide
us
as
to
what
the
material
so
valued
really
was
in
a
book
of
travels
by
one
hentzner
a
foreigner
who
visited
england
in
the
year
mention
is
made
of
a
horn
of
the
unicorn
that
he
was
shown
at
windsor
castle
and
which
he
says
was
valued
at
over
as
indeed
it
very
well
might
be
if
decker
s
line
the
unicorn
whose
horn
is
worth
a
city
written
in
gives
anything
like
a
fair
estimate
of
its
worth
in
the
comptes
royaux
of
france
for
we
find
the
entry
une
manche
d
or
d
un
essay
de
lincourne
pour
attoucher
aux
viandes
de
monseigneur
le
dauphin
and
in
the
year
in
the
inventory
of
the
treasures
of
charles
v
we
have
une
touche
de
licorne
garnie
d
or
pour
faire
essay
many
other
examples
of
a
similar
nature
might
readily
be
brought
forward
it
seems
strange
that
a
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
the
horn
of
the
unicorn
to
detect
the
presence
of
poisons
should
have
endured
for
hundreds
of
years
when
practical
experiment
would
in
half
an
hour
have
convicted
the
thing
whatever
it
was
of
being
a
mockery
a
delusion
and
a
snare
many
curious
beliefs
have
clustered
around
the
elephant
his
sagacity
great
strength
and
association
with
the
wonderful
countries
of
africa
and
india
giving
occasion
for
much
that
is
marvellous
one
old
writer
tells
that
the
elephant
is
a
beast
of
great
strength
but
greater
wit
and
greatest
ambition
insomuch
that
some
have
written
of
them
that
if
you
praise
them
they
will
kill
themselves
with
labour
and
if
you
command
another
before
them
they
will
break
their
hearts
with
emulation
the
beast
is
so
proud
of
his
strength
that
he
never
bows
himself
to
any
and
when
he
is
once
down
as
it
usually
is
with
proud
great
ones
he
cannot
rise
up
again
the
female
elephant
was
supposed
to
rear
her
young
one
in
deep
water
for
fear
lest
the
dragon
should
find
and
devour
it
physiologus
says
that
when
the
bone
of
an
elephant
shall
be
burnt
or
his
hair
singed
the
smell
of
it
shall
drive
away
serpents
and
all
poison
isidore
informs
us
that
the
elephant
is
beyond
measure
great
and
that
it
has
the
form
of
a
goat
a
statement
that
leads
us
to
imagine
that
he
writes
rather
from
hearsay
than
from
personal
knowledge
he
further
tells
us
that
the
creature
cannot
lie
down
a
statement
that
is
entirely
opposed
to
fact
as
they
may
be
seen
rolling
to
and
fro
with
the
greatest
ease
when
bathing
and
after
their
ablutions
recovering
their
feet
with
great
readiness
this
supposed
inability
to
lie
down
necessitated
the
elephant
s
leaning
against
a
wall
or
tree
while
sleeping
and
the
people
of
the
land
when
they
desired
to
capture
one
had
only
to
fell
the
tree
or
undermine
the
wall
while
the
elephant
was
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
the
rude
awakening
that
they
were
preparing
for
him
the
elephant
so
huge
and
strong
to
see
no
perill
fear
d
but
thought
a
sleepe
to
gaine
but
foes
before
had
underminde
the
tree
and
down
he
falls
and
so
by
them
was
slaine
first
trye
then
truste
like
goulde
the
copper
showes
and
nero
oft
in

they
are
provoked
to
madness
at
the
sight
of
blood
or
of
the
juice
of
the
mulberry
tree
they
eat
both
leaves
and
stones
but
if
by
inadvertence
they
swallow
a
chameleon
the
result
is
fatal
unless
they
can
immediately
afterwards
eat
some
olives
as
no
elephant
being
a
vegetarian
would
eat
a
chameleon
knowingly
we
are
reduced
to
the
alternative
that
he
must
eat
him
unconsciously
and
would
therefore
feel
nothing
of
the
need
of
a
prompt
administration
of
antidote
until
the
olives
came
too
late
in
the
family
feud
which
was
held
to
exist
between
the
elephant
and
the
dragon
the
reptile
endeavoured
to
twist
himself
round
the
ponderous
beast
s
feet
and
so
bring
him
to
the
ground
but
the
sagacity
of
the
elephant
here
stood
him
in
good
stead
and
when
he
saw
that
his
fall
was
inevitable
he
also
saw
the
great
advantage
of
flattening
the
life
out
of
his
foe
by
falling
with
all
his
huge
bulk
upon
him
the
blood
produced
by
these
sanguinary
combats
soaked
into
the
earth
and
thus
yielded
the
cinnabar
of
commerce
possibly
some
early
observer
may
have
seen
a
deadly
struggle
in
the
jungle
between
an
elephant
and
some
huge
python
or
boa
and
being
content
to
view
from
some
little
distance
may
have
filled
in
the
details
from
imagination
and
thus
set
the
story
afloat
when
a
tale
of
this
nature
once
gained
credence
one
old
writer
after
another
inserted
it
in
his
work
without
further
question
the
elephant
was
said
to
be
afraid
of
a
mouse
though
the
ancient
authors
unfortunately
fail
to
satisfy
our
very
legitimate
curiosity
as
to
why
this
should
be
so
in
an
old
romance
dealing
with
the
wars
of
the
great
alexander
the
elephants
of
the
enemy
are
put
to
rout
by
the
squeaking
of
a
herd
of
swine
brought
for
the
nonce
on
to
the
tented
field
the
elephant
was
first
used
in
war
by
pyrrhus
who
b
c
employed
these
animals
in
the
war
with
tarentum
against
the
romans
we
learn
also
that
the
carthaginians
in
the
time
of
hannibal
b
c
employed
them
in
their
wars
and
we
have
modern
illustrations
of
the
like
service
amongst
the
various
princes
of
india
when
the
romans
in
leucania
first
saw
the
elephants
in
the
battle
array
of
pyrrhus
they
called
them
leucanian
oxen
next
the
poeni
taught
the
horrible
leucanian
oxen
with
lowered
body
and
snake
like
head
to
endure
the
wounds
of
war
and
to
throw
into
confusion
the
mighty
ranks
of
mars
later
on
the
romans
introduced
them
into
their
own
service
and
in
one
of
the
triumphal
entries
of
c
sar
into
rome
his
chariot
was
drawn
by
forty
elephants
a
little
later
on
we
read
of
their
appearance
in
the
arena
dancing
and
wrestling
with
each
other
walking
on
stretched
ropes
four
of
them
carrying
a
fifth
on
their
shoulders
reposing
on
a
litter
or
couch
and
generally
going
through
those
performances
that
from
the
earliest
times
to
the
travelling
show
of
to
day
have
been
received
by
the
vulgar
with
such
favour
both
pliny
and
plutarch
tell
us
that
if
any
one
elephant
in
such
a
gathering
for
any
reason
fails
to
do
what
is
required
of
him
he
will
study
by
night
in
what
a
workman
would
call
his
own
time
to
achieve
success
and
go
through
the
performance
of
his
own
accord
when
the
rest
of
the
world
is
sleeping
until
he
has
mastered
it
sir
john
maundevile
in
his
voiage
and
travaile
give
s
an
interesting
medi
val
reference
to
an
eastern
potentate
having
olifauntz
or
mo
in
cas
that
he
had
ony
werre
agenst
ony
other
kynge
aboute

than

that
craftily
ben
set

on
the
olifauntes
bakkes
for
to
fryghten
agen
hire
enemyes
how
very
craftily
these
are
set
up
may
be
seen
in
our
illustration
fig
from
an
early
edition
of
the
book
as
we
may
reasonably
assume
from
the
look
of
the
castelle
of
tree
that
it
is
built
in
two
storeys
we
may
judge
the
bulk
of
the
elephant
from
imagining
the
size
that
the
men
must
be
who
are
quartered
in
the
upper
storey
it
will
be
noticed
that
there
is
no
suggestion
of
any
method
of
fastening
the
castelle
to
the
olifaunte
were
we
amongst
the
men
of
arms
who
were
expected
to
take
up
a
position
in
this
fortress
we
should
regard
this
as
a
peculiarly
weak
point
in
the
arrangements
in
marked
contrast
with
this
massive
beast
munster
has
a
funny
picture
of
a
man
ploughing
with
an
elephant
the
elephant
being
in
proportion
to
the
man
of
about
the
size
of
a
shetland
pony
the
ancient
writers
believed
or
taught
that
the
elephant
indulged
in
moon
worship
lian
amongst
others
states
that
at
the
increase
of
the
moon
these
creatures
gathered
long
branches
of
trees
in
the
forest
and
held
them
up
in
adoration
with
uplifted
trunks
to
the
queen
of
night
pliny
too
writes
that
they
have
withall
religious
reverence
with
a
kind
of
devotion
not
only
the
starres
and
planets
but
the
sunne
and
moone
they
also
worship
and
in
very
truth
writers
there
be
who
report
thus
much
of
them
that
when
the
new
moone
beginneth
to
appeare
fresh
and
bright
they
come
doune
by
whole
herds
to
a
certaine
river
named
amelus
in
the
deserts
and
forests
of
mauritania
where
after
that
they
are
washed
and
solemnlie
purified
by
sprinkling
and
dashing
themselves
all
over
with
the
water
and
have
saluted
and
adored
after
their
manner
their
planet
they
returne
againe
unto
the
woods
and
chases
carrying
before
them
their
young
calves
that
be
wearied
and
tired
a
grand
and
pious
pilgrimage
of
pachyderms
another
strange
idea
of
the
ancients
was
that
the
elephant
when
pursued
by
the
hunters
beats
its
tusks
against
the
trees
until
they
drop
off
as
he
has
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
it
is
his
ivory
rather
than
himself
that
they
want
the
elephant
sagacious
beast
would
appear
to
have
as
good
a
notion
of
the
value
of
his
tusks
to
the
hunter
as
his
pursuer
himself
has
we
are
told
that
when
they
chance
to
be
environed
and
compassed
round
with
hunters
they
set
foremoste
in
the
ranke
to
bee
seene
those
of
the
heard
that
have
the
least
teeth
to
the
end
that
their
price
might
not
be
thought
worth
the
hazard
and
venture
in
chace
for
them
but
afterwards
when
they
see
the
hunters
eager
and
themselves
over
matched
and
wearie
they
breake
them
with
running
against
the
hard
trees
and
leaving
them
behind
escape
by
this
ransome
as
it
were
out
of
their
hands
another
curious
fact
is
that
their
skin
is
covered
neither
with
haire
nor
bristle
no
not
so
much
as
in
their
taile
which
might
serve
them
in
goode
steade
to
driue
away
the
busie
and
troublesome
flie
for
as
vast
and
huge
a
beast
as
he
is
the
flie
haunteth
and
stingeth
him
but
full
their
skinne
is
of
crosse
wrinckles
lattiswise
and
besides
that
the
smell
thereof
is
able
to
draw
and
allure
such
vermine
to
it
and
therefore
when
they
are
laid
stretched
along
and
perceive
the
flies
by
whole
swarmes
settled
on
their
skin
sodainly
they
draw
those
cranies
and
crevices
together
close
and
so
crush
them
all
to
death
this
serues
them
instead
of
taile
maine
and
long
haire
one
striking
instance
the
more
of
the
wonderful
compensatory
powers
of
nature
illustration
fig
it
is
by
no
means
an
incurious
subject
to
trace
the
sources
of
information
possessed
by
our
ancestors
of
subjects
of
natural
history
that
have
now
become
so
familiar
as
to
create
a
surprise
that
fables
respecting
them
should
so
long
have
been
currently
received
in
regard
to
the
elephant
the
earliest
notions
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
had
of
it
must
have
been
from
the
narratives
of
pilgrims
and
other
travellers
from
the
east
the
first
instance
after
classic
times
of
an
elephant
being
brought
to
the
west
occurred
in
the
year
when
one
was
sent
as
a
present
from
the
famous
caliph
haroum
al
raschid
to
the
emperor
charlemagne
and
must
have
occasioned
no
small
degree
of
astonishment
matthew
prior
mentions
that
the
soldan
of
babylon
malek
el
kamel
sent
an
elephant
as
a
choice
present
to
the
emperor
frederic
ii
in
the
year
but
it
was
not
till
that
the
first
specimen
was
seen
in
england
this
was
a
present
from
the
king
of
france
to
our
henry
iii
the
chronicler
john
of
oxenedes
gives
full
details
of
the
arrival
of
this
animal
in
london
and
tells
us
of
the
enormous
crowds
that
flocked
together
to
behold
it
the
writ
is
still
existing
that
was
sent
to
the
sheriff
of
kent
dated
february
rd
directing
him
to
go
in
person
to
dover
together
with
john
gouch
the
king
s
servant
to
arrange
in
what
manner
the
king
s
present
might
most
conveniently
be
brought
over
and
to
find
for
the
said
john
a
ship
and
all
things
necessary
and
if
by
the
advice
of
mariners
and
others
it
could
be
brought
by
water
directing
it
to
be
so
conveyed
it
was
however
eventually
landed
at
sandwich
and
walked
thence
to
london
another
writ
dated
the
th
of
the
same
month
ordered
the
sheriffs
of
london
to
cause
to
be
built
at
the
tower
a
house
for
it
forty
feet
in
length
and
twenty
in
breadth
the
elephant
itself
was
ten
feet
in
height
and
ten
years
old
it
only
lived
two
years
of
this
elephant
matthew
prior
made
a
very
good
representation
and
his
original
drawing
may
still
be
seen
amongst
the
cottonian
mss
in
the
british
museum
this
he
expressly
tells
us
was
taken
from
the
life
ipso
elephante
exemplariter
assistente
an
equally
good
but
smaller
drawing
occurs
at
the
close
of
the
chronicle
of
john
de
walingeford
a
monk
in
the
abbey
of
st
albans
this
also
may
be
seen
amongst
the
cottonian
collection
the
historians
of
the
time
regarded
the
new
arrival
as
a
perfect
prodigy
as
they
very
well
might
do
when
we
remember
how
the
british
public
comparatively
satiated
with
wild
beasts
flocked
in
hundreds
of
thousands
some
few
years
ago
to
see
the
first
hippopotamus
they
gave
long
and
detailed
accounts
of
the
habits
of
the
elephant
in
a
wild
state
details
which
were
eagerly
read
by
the
great
multitude
seeking
for
some
information
on
this
strange
monster
in
their
midst
these
more
or
less
trustworthy
facts
though
mingled
with
many
obvious
absurdities
would
seem
to
show
that
a
fair
amount
of
knowledge
of
the
creature
had
penetrated
thus
far
some
of
the
information
was
at
least
curious
as
for
instance
that
elephants
will
not
enter
a
ship
to
cross
the
sea
until
an
oath
is
taken
before
them
by
their
conductor
that
they
shall
return
and
that
if
they
meet
a
man
in
the
desert
who
has
lost
his
bearings
they
will
very
courteously
conduct
him
to
the
right
path
either
of
these
indicate
a
high
degree
of
sagacity
and
a
good
knowledge
of
human
speech
the
latter
proceeding
was
probably
a
delicate
way
of
conveying
to
the
wandering
botanist
or
prospecting
engineer
that
he
was
a
trespasser
on
their
domain
and
a
gentle
hint
to
him
that
he
would
be
on
the
right
path
when
he
took
his
leave
and
left
them
in
undisturbed
possession
there
is
no
record
in
modern
times
of
an
african
tribe
endeavouring
to
domesticate
the
wild
elephant
or
to
utilize
it
in
warfare
but
marco
polo
mentions
that
in
the
south
east
of
africa
the
people
are
very
warlike
and
fight
having
no
horses
upon
elephants
and
camels
upon
the
backs
of
the
former
he
tells
us
that
they
place
castles
capable
of
containing
from
fifteen
to
twenty
armed
men
and
that
previous
to
the
conflict
they
give
the
elephants
draughts
of
wine
to
make
them
more
spirited
and
furious
in
the
assault
there
is
no
creature
saith
the
writer
of
the
speculum
mundi
amongst
all
the
beasts
of
the
world
which
hath
so
great
and
ample
demonstration
of
the
power
and
wisdom
of
almighty
god
as
the
elephant
both
from
proportion
of
body
and
disposition
of
spirit
and
it
is
admirable
to
behold
the
industrie
of
our
ancient
forefathers
and
noble
desire
to
benefit
us
their
posteritie
by
searching
into
the
qualities
of
every
beast
to
discover
what
benefits
and
harms
may
come
by
them
to
mankinde
having
never
been
afraid
of
the
wildest
but
they
tamed
them
and
the
greatest
but
they
also
set
upon
them
witness
this
beast
of
which
we
now
speak
being
like
a
living
mountaine
in
quantitie
and
outward
appearance
yet
by
them
so
handled
as
no
little
dog
could
be
made
more
serviceable
tame
and
tractable
according
to
the
belief
of
one
medi
val
writer
at
least
the
capture
of
the
elephant
is
not
a
matter
of
much
difficulty
though
having
caught
him
he
seems
to
find
no
better
use
for
him
than
to
kill
him
as
so
much
raw
material
for
the
dyer
s
vat
instead
of
utilizing
his
gigantic
strength
and
magnificent
willingness
for
work
in
the
service
of
man
nowadays
the
men
do
most
of
the
elephant
catching
but
among
the
ethiopians
says
one
ancient
authority
on
the
subject
bartholomew
anglicus
in
some
countries
elephants
be
hunted
in
this
wise
there
go
in
the
desert
two
maidens
and
one
of
them
beareth
a
vessel
and
the
other
a
sword
and
these
maidens
begin
to
sing
alone
and
the
beast
hath
liking
when
he
heareth
their
song
and
cometh
to
them
and
falleth
asleep
anon
for
liking
of
the
song
an
explanation
of
the
drowsiness
that
would
scarcely
nowaday
be
held
satisfactory
at
any
concert
or
social
function
of
the
kind
then
the
one
maid
sticketh
him
in
the
throat
or
in
the
side
with
a
sword
and
the
other
taketh
his
blood
in
a
vessel
and
with
that
blood
the
people
of
the
country
dye
cloth
and
done
colour
it
therewith
the
writer
prefaces
his
story
by
the
assertion
that
it
is
full
wonderful
and
so
it
is
when
regarded
from
our
modern
standpoint
but
to
anyone
who
could
believe
that
unicorns
could
be
captured
in
a
very
similar
way
we
should
have
thought
that
the
narrative
would
have
seemed
most
matter
of
fact
and
prosaic
the
ladies
of
ethiopia
must
have
been
of
considerably
stouter
heart
than
some
fair
maidens
of
the
present
day
who
dare
not
enter
where
the
presence
of
mouse
or
cockroach
is
suspected
great
good
natured
beast
as
the
elephant
is
he
has
more
than
one
most
merciless
and
vindictive
foe
there
ben
bestes
or
maundevile
is
in
error
men
clepen
hem
loerancz
and
thei
han
a
blak
hed
and
thre
longe
hornes
trenchant
in
the
front
scharpe
as
a
sword
and
the
body
is
sclender
and
he
is
a
fulle
felonous
best
and
he
chacethe
and
sleethe
the
olifaunt
what
can
have
ever
prompted
and
suggested
the
idea
of
such
a
very
unpleasant
tricorn
it
is
impossible
to
say
in
real
life
the
elephant
and
the
rhinoceros
are
sometimes
at
feud
but
clearly
the
massive
rhinoceros
cannot
be
this
very
slender
and
objectionable
three
horned
beast
we
have
seen
too
that
the
dragon
cannot
let
the
elephant
alone
he
is
to
the
full
as
felonous
as
the
loerancz
pliny
held
that
this
constant
unpleasantness
on
the
part
of
the
reptile
was
a
sport
of
nature
in
other
words
that
nature
personified
as
the
romans
personified
the
winds
the
mountain
streams
and
so
forth
felt
a
real
delight
in
seeing
a
downright
fight
between
two
such
doughty
antagonists
as
the
dragon
was
always
the
aggressor
while
the
elephant
only
wished
to
be
let
alone
and
merely
used
his
strength
in
self
defence
when
so
wantonly
attacked
one
s
sympathies
must
necessarily
be
with
the
latter
illustration
fig
as
this
view
degraded
nature
to
the
level
of
an
emperor
feasting
his
eyes
on
the
sanguinary
horrors
of
a
gladiatorial
show
or
to
that
of
a
bull
baiter
or
other
member
of
the
fancy
it
was
not
altogether
acceptable
to
thinking
men
as
it
must
have
been
difficult
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
the
creator
and
sustainer
of
all
and
yet
feel
that
one
was
in
the
grasp
of
a
power
so
capricious
relentless
and
unfair
nor
was
the
narration
even
fair
to
the
dragon
as
there
was
no
suggestion
in
it
that
the
attack
was
made
for
the
legitimate
purpose
of
obtaining
food
the
story
as
it
stood
pointed
to
a
depth
of
sheer
vindictiveness
that
even
a
dragon
with
any
self
respect
would
resent
the
imputation
of
the
theory
therefore
was
started
that
while
during
the
great
heats
of
the
dry
season
the
dragon
s
blood
was
almost
at
boiling
point
the
blood
of
the
elephant
was
singularly
and
exceptionally
cold
and
thus
made
the
creature
a
most
welcome
prey
the
dragon
with
parched
throat
and
molten
veins
therefore
went
as
naturally
for
an
elephant
as
the
members
of
a
picnic
party
in
july
go
for
the
iced
lemonade
or
claret
cup
our
ancestors
had
immense
faith
in
blood
letting
but
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
and
pliny
tells
us
that
a
hippopotamus
when
good
living
has
told
upon
him
and
he
is
suffering
from
plethora
goes
ashore
to
where
he
has
seen
that
the
river
reeds
have
been
newly
cut
and
presses
one
of
the
sharp
edges
of
a
stem
into
his
leg
and
thus
vigorously
bleeds
himself
when
the
process
has
given
him
the
desired
relief
and
there
is
no
immediate
fear
of
gout
or
apoplexy
he
smears
the
wound
over
with
the
nile
mud
and
quickly
heals
it
munster
s
idea
of
the
hippopotamus
as
shown
in
his
book
from
which
we
have
made
the
facsimile
fig
is
a
much
more
genuine
notion
of
a
river
horse
than
the
beast
as
we
see
him
in
the
zoological
gardens
the
way
he
is
dashing
up
the
stream
around
him
as
he
gallops
through
the
water
is
a
caution
the
panther
was
believed
to
have
an
especial
power
of
fascination
a
gift
ascribed
by
some
to
the
beauty
of
his
coat
and
by
others
to
his
odour
the
savour
of
the
larger
species
of
felid
as
we
find
it
in
zoological
collections
is
malodorous
rather
than
fascinating
though
the
creatures
could
doubtless
plead
in
their
own
defence
that
they
were
placed
under
artificial
circumstances
in
one
of
spenser
s
sonnets
we
find
the
first
theory
upheld
in
the
lines
the
panther
knowing
that
his
spotted
hide
doth
please
all
beasts
but
that
his
looks
them
fray
within
a
bush
his
dreadful
head
doth
hide
to
let
them
gaze
while
he
on
them
may
prey
in
the
eighth
book
of
pliny
s
natural
history
the
second
theory
is
maintained
it
is
said
that
all
four
footed
beasts
are
wonderfully
delighted
and
enticed
by
the
smell
of
panthers
but
their
hideous
looke
and
crabbed
countenance
which
they
bewray
so
soone
as
they
show
their
heads
skareth
them
as
much
againe
and
therefore
their
manner
is
to
hide
their
heads
and
when
they
have
trained
other
beasts
within
their
reach
by
their
sweet
savour
they
flee
upon
them
and
worrie
them
in
a
ms
presented
by
sir
william
segar
to
king
james
i
and
now
no
in
the
harleian
collection
we
come
across
a
combination
of
the
theories
the
result
being
a
fascination
of
the
most
killing
description
the
panther
is
admired
of
all
beasts
for
the
beauty
of
his
skyn
being
spotted
with
variable
colours
and
beloued
and
followed
of
them
for
the
sweetnesse
of
his
breath
that
streameth
forth
of
his
nostrils
and
ears
like
smoke
which
our
paynters
mistaking
corruptlie
doe
make
fire
this
detail
is
given
in
the
manuscript
in
explanation
of
one
of
the
badges
of
king
henry
vi
a
panther
passant
guardant
argent
spotted
of
all
colours
with
vapour
issuant
from
his
mouth
and
ears
sir
john
maundevile
professed
to
see
in
the
capital
of
far
cathay
a
palace
with
its
halls
covered
with
red
skins
of
animals
called
panthers
fair
beasts
and
well
smelling
so
that
for
the
sweet
odour
of
the
skins
no
evil
air
may
enter
into
the
palace
the
skins
are
as
red
as
blood
and
shine
so
bright
against
the
sun
that
a
man
may
scarce
look
at
them
and
many
people
worship
the
beasts
when
they
meet
them
first
in
a
morning
for
their
great
virtue
and
for
the
good
smell
that
they
have
and
the
skins
they
value
more
than
if
they
were
plates
of
fine
gold
this
is
very
clearly
not
a
statement
springing
from
personal
observation
some
old
writers
of
imaginative
turn
of
mind
regarded
the
panther
as
the
emblem
of
providence
and
foresight
the
number
of
eye
like
spots
on
his
coat
suggesting
the
idea
that
he
was
well
able
to
look
before
behind
and
around
him
while
others
declared
that
he
bore
on
his
shoulder
one
particular
spot
of
the
shape
of
the
moon
and
that
this
passed
through
the
various
phases
of
form
from
crescent
to
full
circle
simultaneously
with
the
moon
itself
the
tastes
of
the
panther
would
appear
to
be
considerably
more
refined
than
those
of
the
other
great
carnivor
an
idea
that
we
base
on
the
statement
of
the
author
of
the
speculum
mundi
now
the
reason
why
these
beasts
have
such
a
sweet
breath
is
in
regard
that
they
are
so
much
delighted
with
the
kinde
of
spices
and
daintie
aromaticall
trees
insomuch
that
as
some
affirm
they
will
go
many
hundred
miles
in
time
of
the
yeare
when
these
things
are
in
season
and
all
for
the
love
they
bear
to
them
but
above
all
their
chief
delight
is
in
the
gumme
of
camphire
watching
that
tree
very
carefully
to
the
end
they
may
preserve
it
for
their
owne
use
the
notion
of
the
panther
prowling
round
and
keeping
his
eye
on
the
camphor
the
while
is
distinctly
quaint
porta
tells
us
that
the
hy
na
and
the
panther
are
in
continual
enmity
and
that
even
the
skin
of
a
dead
hy
na
makes
the
panther
run
away
though
we
should
ourselves
have
thought
that
the
live
hy
na
skin
and
all
would
have
been
no
match
for
the
panther
nay
this
feeling
is
so
intense
that
one
old
author
tells
us
that
even
if
one
hangs
up
the
two
skins
together
the
antipathy
outlives
death
itself
and
the
panther
s
skin
will
lose
all
the
hair
this
notion
of
antipathy
between
various
animals
is
a
very
strong
point
with
old
writers
a
lion
s
skin
wasteth
and
eating
out
the
skins
of
other
beasts
and
so
doth
the
wolves
skin
eat
up
the
lambs
skin
likewise
the
feathers
of
other
fowles
being
put
among
eagles
feathers
do
rot
and
consume
of
themselves
the
beast
florus
and
the
bird
githus
are
at
such
mortal
enmity
that
when
they
are
dead
their
blood
cannot
be
mingled
together
porta
is
very
learned
on
this
matter
and
tells
us
that
an
elephant
is
afraid
of
a
ram
this
must
clearly
be
from
some
invincible
feeling
of
antipathy
for
there
is
little
doubt
but
that
in
fair
fight
the
ram
would
be
nowhere
yet
we
learn
that
unmanageable
as
an
elephant
may
be
as
soon
as
ever
he
seeth
a
ram
he
waxeth
meek
and
his
fury
ceaseth
one
can
only
wonder
over
and
over
again
how
it
comes
that
such
ideas
should
gain
credence
for
centuries
when
the
whole
matter
could
so
readily
be
brought
to
the
touchstone
of
experience
the
doctrine
of
sympathy
and
antipathy
and
more
especially
the
latter
half
of
it
was
of
immense
value
in
medi
val
medicine
as
an
example
of
sympathy
we
may
instance
the
affection
that
was
held
to
exist
between
the
goat
and
the
partridge
hence
for
whatever
one
of
them
was
a
remedy
the
other
became
equally
available
the
prescriptions
were
interchangeable
and
one
used
one
or
the
other
in
full
faith
that
either
was
equally
valuable
as
indeed
might
very
possibly
be
the
case
as
examples
of
the
antipathetic
treatment
one
may
instance
the
following
the
ape
of
all
things
cannot
abide
a
snail
now
the
ape
is
a
drunken
beast
for
they
are
wont
to
take
an
ape
by
making
him
drunk
and
a
snail
well
wash
d
is
a
remedy
against
drunkenesse
the
wolf
is
afraid
of
the
urchin
thence
if
we
wash
our
mouth
and
throat
with
urchin
s
blood
it
will
make
our
voice
shrill
though
before
it
were
hoarse
and
dull
like
a
wolves
voice
the
hart
and
the
serpent
are
at
continuall
enemity
the
serpent
as
soon
as
he
seeth
the
hart
gets
him
into
his
hole
but
the
hart
draws
him
out
again
with
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
and
devours
him
hence
it
is
that
the
fat
and
the
blood
of
harts
and
the
stones
that
grow
in
their
eyes
are
ministered
as
fit
remedies
against
the
biting
and
stinging
of
serpents
likewise
the
breath
of
elephants
draws
serpents
out
of
their
dens
and
therefore
the
members
of
elephants
burned
drive
away
serpents
so
also
the
crowing
of
a
cock
affrights
the
basilisk
and
he
fights
with
serpents
to
defend
his
hens
hence
the
broth
of
a
cock
is
good
remedy
against
the
poison
of
serpents
the
stellion
which
is
a
beast
like
a
lyzard
is
an
enemy
to
the
scorpions
and
therefore
the
oyle
of
him
being
purified
is
good
to
anoint
the
place
which
is
stricken
by
the
scorpion
a
swine
eats
up
a
salamander
without
danger
and
is
good
against
the
poison
thereof
all
these
and
many
other
hints
of
like
value
may
be
found
in
the
pages
of
porta
the
edition
of
natural
magick
by
john
baptist
porta
from
which
we
have
made
these
extracts
is
a
somewhat
late
one
as
the
preface
begins
courteous
reader
if
this
work
made
by
me
in
my
youth
when
i
was
hardly
fifteen
years
old
was
so
generally
received
and
with
so
great
applause
that
it
was
forthwith
translated
into
many
languages
as
italian
french
spanish
arabick
and
passed
through
the
hands
of
incomparable
men
i
hope
that
now
coming
forth
from
me
that
am
fifty
years
old
it
shall
be
more
dearly
entertained
for
when
i
saw
the
first
fruits
of
my
labours
received
with
so
great
alacrity
of
mind
i
was
moved
by
these
good
omens
and
therefore
have
adventured
to
send
it
once
more
forth
but
with
an
equipage
more
rich
and
noble
from
the
first
time
it
appeared
it
is
now
thirty
five
years
and
without
any
derogation
of
my
modesty
be
it
spoken
if
ever
any
man
laboured
earnestly
to
disclose
the
secrets
of
nature
it
was
i
after
nearly
forty
years
therefore
of
reflection
observation
and
criticism
he
feels
that
his
medical
hints
on
this
subject
of
antipathy
have
borne
the
test
of
time
and
may
well
take
their
place
amongst
the
other
secrets
of
nature
divulged
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
the
hy
na
was
held
to
possess
the
power
of
counterfeiting
man
s
speech
and
of
turning
the
gift
to
profitable
account
by
going
up
at
night
to
a
shepherd
s
or
woodman
s
hut
and
calling
out
the
man
s
name
upon
the
man
s
going
forth
to
see
who
wanted
him
he
was
promptly
torn
to
pieces
the
manticora
also
according
to
juba
possessed
this
uncanny
power
of
imitating
human
speech
and
turned
its
conversational
powers
to
the
same
treacherous
use
it
was
also
held
that
if
a
hy
na
made
a
circuit
three
times
round
any
animal
its
victim
lost
all
power
of
escape
and
could
not
stir
a
foot
according
to
some
ancient
writers
the
animal
had
a
stone
called
hy
nia
in
its
eye
and
this
being
placed
under
a
man
s
tongue
imparted
to
him
the
gift
of
prophecy
aristotle
taught
that
the
eyes
of
this
creature
could
change
colour
a
thousand
times
a
day
and
this
is
but
a
sample
of
many
other
curious
and
absurd
stories
concerning
the
beast
sir
gardner
wilkinson
mentions
a
strange
fancy
believed
in
by
the
abyssinians
that
a
race
of
people
who
inhabited
their
country
had
the
power
of
changing
their
form
at
pleasure
being
sometimes
men
and
at
others
hy
nas
in
the
middle
ages
the
wolf
seems
to
have
been
in
decidedly
bad
odour
he
was
probably
too
well
known
to
be
respected
and
in
the
long
dreary
nights
of
winter
proved
himself
a
terribly
bad
neighbour
and
a
very
undesirable
travelling
companion
for
those
who
had
to
cross
amidst
the
snows
the
almost
trackless
wastes
amongst
the
scandinavians
the
wolf
held
a
conspicuous
place
in
tradition
and
mythology
eclipses
of
the
sun
and
moon
were
held
to
be
caused
by
two
great
wolves
that
were
always
pursuing
them
through
the
heavens
the
wolf
too
was
the
companion
of
odin
the
god
of
war
and
at
his
feet
these
creatures
crouched
while
he
fed
them
with
the
flesh
of
his
enemies
it
was
an
accepted
belief
that
if
a
man
encountered
a
wolf
and
the
creature
caught
sight
of
him
before
he
saw
it
he
became
dumb
scott
refers
to
this
old
notion
in
his
quentin
durward
where
in
the
eighteenth
chapter
lady
hameline
exclaims
our
young
companion
has
seen
a
wolf
and
has
lost
his
tongue
in
consequence
the
ground
or
occasionall
originall
thereof
browne
in
his
exposure
of
vulgar
errors
would
endeavour
to
persuade
us
was
probably
the
amazement
and
sudden
silence
the
unexpected
appearance
of
wolves
doe
often
put
upon
travellers
not
by
a
supposed
vapour
or
venomous
emanation
but
a
vehement
fear
which
naturally
produceth
obmutescence
and
sometimes
irrecoverable
silence
but
it
would
appear
to
be
a
still
simpler
procedure
and
one
with
a
good
deal
to
recommend
it
to
deny
that
there
is
an
atom
of
truth
in
the
story
in
another
old
natural
history
before
us
we
read
that
the
wolf
when
he
falls
upon
a
hog
or
a
goat
or
such
small
beast
does
not
immediately
kill
them
but
leads
them
by
the
ear
with
all
the
speed
he
can
to
a
crew
of
ravenous
wolves
who
instantly
tear
them
to
pieces
we
should
have
thought
that
the
reverse
had
been
more
probable
and
that
the
wolves
that
had
nothing
would
have
come
with
all
the
speed
they
could
upon
their
more
successful
comrade
but
if
the
old
writer
s
story
be
true
it
opens
out
a
fine
trait
of
hitherto
unsuspected
unselfishness
in
the
character
of
the
wolf
john
leo
in
his
history
of
africa
declares
that
the
dragon
is
the
progeny
of
the
eagle
and
wolf
perhaps
this
may
be
so
but
probably
the
conception
that
most
of
our
readers
have
of
the
dragon
is
that
he
was
a
considerably
more
formidable
beast
than
such
a
parentage
fierce
as
it
is
quite
suggests
an
old
heraldic
author
tells
us
how
that
the
wolfe
procureth
all
other
beasts
to
fight
and
contention
he
seeketh
to
deuour
the
sheepe
that
beaste
which
is
of
all
others
the
most
hurtlesse
simple
and
void
of
guile
thirsting
continually
after
their
blood
yea
nature
hath
planted
so
inveterate
an
hatred
atweene
the
wolfe
and
the
sheepe
that
being
dead
yet
in
the
secrete
operation
of
nature
appeareth
there
a
sufficient
trial
of
their
discording
natures
so
that
the
enimity
betweene
them
seemeth
not
to
dye
with
their
bodies
for
if
there
be
put
vpon
a
harp
or
any
such
like
instrument
strings
made
of
the
intrailles
of
a
sheepe
and
amongst
them
but
onely
one
made
of
the
intraills
of
a
wolfe
be
the
musician
never
so
cuning
in
his
skil
yet
can
he
not
reconcile
them
to
an
vnity
and
concorde
of
sounds
so
discording
alwayes
is
that
string
of
the
wolfe
the
inveterate
enmity
between
the
two
creatures
is
scarcely
in
accordance
with
the
facts
for
the
wolf
from
its
appreciation
of
mutton
as
an
article
of
diet
is
really
partial
to
the
sheep
and
is
always
glad
to
make
its
acquaintance
another
old
herald
tells
us
that
the
wolfe
loveth
to
plaie
with
a
child
and
will
not
hurt
it
till
it
be
extreme
hungrie
what
time
he
will
not
spare
to
devour
it
he
dwells
also
upon
some
of
the
animal
s
prejudices
as
that
he
watcheth
much
and
feareth
fier
and
stones
to
be
wherled
at
him
a
feeling
that
one
finds
no
difficulty
in
sympathizing
with
and
adds
that
there
is
nothing
that
he
hateth
so
much
as
the
knocking
togither
of
two
flint
stones
the
which
he
feareth
more
than
the
hunters
he
also
mentions
the
curious
physiological
fact
that
the
wolf
may
not
bend
his
neck
backward
in
no
moneth
of
the
yere
but
in
may
but
gives
us
no
inkling
as
to
the
reason
for
this
the
wearing
of
wolf
skin
was
held
to
be
a
valuable
preservative
against
epilepsy
but
those
who
were
unable
to
procure
this
found
an
equally
serviceable
remedy
in
wearing
a
small
portion
of
an
ass
s
hoof
in
a
ring
the
wolf
skin
coat
also
was
in
request
as
a
preservative
against
hydrophobia
and
there
was
nothing
better
in
the
good
old
times
than
a
wolfs
head
under
the
pillow
to
secure
a
good
night
s
rest
albertus
magnus
in
his
work
de
virtutibus
herbarum
tells
us
that
if
we
wrap
the
tooth
of
a
wolf
in
a
bay
leaf
and
carry
it
about
with
us
no
one
will
have
the
power
to
vex
or
annoy
us
according
to
porta
and
he
we
have
seen
professes
to
have
gone
into
the
secrets
of
nature
as
deeply
as
most
men
who
pose
as
authorities
the
rook
is
killed
by
eating
the
reliques
of
flesh
the
wolf
hath
fed
on
this
would
appear
to
be
a
discovery
of
porta
s
own
we
do
not
find
any
suggestion
of
it
so
far
as
we
are
aware
in
any
other
author
a
creature
called
the
stag
wolf
if
we
may
credit
these
ancient
authors
and
there
is
much
saving
virtue
in
this
if
had
the
curious
peculiarity
that
if
while
he
was
devouring
his
prey
he
chanced
to
look
backward
he
straightway
forgot
that
he
was
already
provided
with
a
dinner
and
would
at
once
start
off
for
one
with
all
the
zeal
that
his
supposititious
famishing
condition
called
for
the
bear
has
not
escaped
the
observation
of
the
lover
of
the
marvellous
though
we
should
have
thought
that
our
forefathers
with
their
bear
baiting
proclivities
would
have
had
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
creature
to
protect
them
from
falling
into
gross
error
one
of
the
most
firmly
accepted
beliefs
in
ancient
and
medi
val
days
was
that
the
cubs
were
born
a
merely
shapeless
mass
and
owed
what
after
beauty
of
form
they
possessed
to
the
assiduous
care
of
their
mother
hence
an
ancient
scribe
hath
it
at
the
firste
they
seeme
to
be
a
lumpe
of
white
flesh
without
any
forme
little
bigger
than
rattons
without
eyes
and
wanting
hair
this
rude
lumpe
with
licking
they
fashion
by
little
and
little
into
some
shape
shakespeare
it
will
be
remembered
compares
gloucester
in
king
henry
vi
to
an
unlick
d
bear
whelp
while
dryden
writes
the
cubs
of
bears
a
living
lump
appear
when
whelp
d
and
no
determined
figure
wear
the
mother
licks
them
into
shape
and
gives
as
much
of
form
as
she
herself
receives
the
device
of
the
great
venetian
painter
titian
was
a
she
bear
licking
her
cubs
into
shape
our
readers
will
probably
recall
the
lines
in
hudibras
a
bear
s
a
savage
beast
of
all
most
ugly
and
unnatural
whelp
d
without
form
until
the
dam
has
lick
d
it
into
shape
and
frame
which
opinion
notwithstanding
quoth
browne
in
his
assault
on
the
vulgar
errors
of
his
day
is
not
only
repugnant
unto
the
sense
of
everyone
that
shall
enquire
into
it
but
of
exact
and
deliberate
experiment
it
is
moreover
injurious
unto
reason
and
much
impugneth
the
course
and
providence
of
nature
to
conceive
a
birth
should
be
ordained
before
there
is
a
formation
besides
what
few
take
notice
of
men
do
hereby
in
a
high
measure
vilifie
the
works
of
god
imputing
that
unto
the
tongue
of
a
beast
browne
s
ideas
were
we
have
already
seen
far
in
advance
of
his
time
and
he
took
the
trouble
to
do
what
many
who
wrote
on
the
subject
before
him
failed
to
do
went
to
look
at
some
young
bears
though
the
belief
in
the
idea
has
died
away
the
remembrance
of
the
superstition
still
survives
in
the
notion
of
licking
youngsters
into
shape
at
school
by
such
appeals
to
body
or
mind
as
may
seem
most
efficacious
and
persuasive
it
was
held
that
the
bear
found
no
little
nutriment
in
sucking
his
own
paws
and
in
old
books
on
natural
history
he
may
often
be
found
thus
figured
beaumont
and
fletcher
embody
the
old
belief
in
their
bonduca
where
we
read
of
those
just
like
a
brace
of
bear
whelps
close
and
crafty
sucking
their
fingers
for
their
food
it
has
long
been
an
accepted
belief
in
rural
england
that
a
child
who
has
had
a
ride
upon
a
bear
will
escape
whooping
cough
a
belief
that
has
had
great
pecuniary
value
to
the
savoyards
and
others
who
take
a
dancing
bear
through
the
villages
as
the
rustics
gladly
fee
them
for
the
privilege
of
a
ride
for
their
children
and
the
attendant
immunity
from
one
of
the
most
infectious
and
distressing
of
the
minor
ailments
of
childhood
we
have
long
been
familiar
with
the
idea
that
bears
attacked
bee
hives
but
we
have
accepted
the
notion
that
the
bears
did
so
from
an
appreciation
of
the
honey
that
they
found
therein
it
appears
however
that
the
bear
does
it
really
as
a
kind
of
stimulant
the
stinging
of
the
angry
bees
giving
him
just
a
welcome
titillation
and
arousing
him
from
a
certain
torpidity
that
at
times
oppresses
him
and
which
he
rightly
feels
should
be
fought
against
others
tell
us
that
the
outraged
bees
justly
angry
at
the
overturning
of
their
home
and
the
pillage
of
their
store
supply
by
the
energy
of
their
attack
and
the
keenness
of
their
stings
just
that
pleasant
piquant
set
off
to
the
epicurean
bear
that
the
over
richness
and
cloying
sweetness
of
the
honey
seems
to
call
for
yet
a
third
theory
is
that
they
are
many
times
subject
to
dimnesse
of
sight
for
which
cause
especially
they
seeke
after
honeycombes
that
the
bees
might
settle
upon
them
and
with
their
stings
make
them
bleed
about
the
head
and
by
that
meanes
discharge
them
of
that
heavinesse
which
troubleth
their
eyes
possibly
three
more
equally
reasonable
theories
might
be
forthcoming
on
searching
for
them
in
the
various
old
tomes
in
which
the
wisdom
of
our
forefathers
is
enshrined
a
considerable
amount
of
folk
lore
has
gathered
round
the
hare
it
was
held
to
be
a
favourable
omen
to
meet
certain
beasts
early
in
the

it

of

carew
in
his

of

mentions
that
to
talk
of
hares
or
such
uncouth
things
was
regarded
as
omnious
of
coming
ill
by
the
fishermen
and
at
some
places
on
the
coast
until
quite
recently
or
possibly
even
till
to
day
for
such
notions
die
out
very
slowly
if
a
fisherman
going
down
to
his
boat
were
to
see
a
hare
cross
his
path
he
would
not
that
day
go
to
sea
how
superstitiously
we
mind
our
evils
the
throwing
down
of
salt
or
crossing
of
a
hare
bleeding
at
nose
the
stumbling
of
a
horse
or
singing
of
a
cricket
are
of
power
to
daunt
whole
man
in
us
this
superstition
arose
from
the
belief
that
witches
sometimes
transformed
themselves
into
hares
in
ellison
s
trip
to
benwell
we
find
the
following
congratulatory
lines
nor
did
we
meet
with
nimble
feet
one
little
fearful
lepus
that
certain
sign
as
some
divine
of
fortune
bad
to
keep
us
in
aubrey
s
remaines
of
gentilisme
and
judaisme
written
in
the
year
it
is
stated
as
found
by
experience
that
when
one
keepes
a
hare
alive
and
feedeth
him
till
he
have
occasion
to
eat
him
if
he
telles
before
he
killes
him
that
he
will
doe
so
the
hare
will
thereupon
be
found
dead
having
killed
himself
one
really
scarcely
sees
what
the
creature
gains
by
this
proceeding
old
writers
tell
us
that
when
the
hare
is
fainting
with
the
heat
a
state
of
things
that
one
may
hope
does
not
often
occur
it
recruits
its
strength
by
munching
up
sowthistle
topsell
says
that
there
is
no
leporine
ailment
that
this
plant
will
not
cure
and
that
directly
the
hare
feels
a
little
unwell
he
seeks
sowthistle
and
goes
in
for
a
course
of
diet
askham
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
yf
a
hare
eate
of
this
herbe
in
somer
when
he
is
mad
he
shal
be
hole
but
as
hares
are
proverbially
held
to
be
specially
non
compos
mentis
in
march
the
treatment
seems
to
come
a
little
late
all
boys
who
have
kept
rabbits
will
recall
how
appreciatively
they
nibble
up
the
succulent
sowthistle
leaves
and
stems
and
probably
it
is
just
as
welcome
to
the
hares
not
as
a
medicinal
herb
or
a
help
to
sanity
but
as
a
toothsome
item
in
the
daily
fare
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
henry
iv
i
shakespeare
uses
the
expression
melancholy
as
a
hare
and
as
it
was
believed
in
medi
val
days
that
those
who
partook
of
the
flesh
of
any
animal
thereby
partook
also
of
its
nature
the
flesh
of
the
hare
was
supposed
to
generate
melancholia
and
was
therefore
avoided
why
the
hare
should
be
considered
of
a
desponding
temperament
no
one
seemed
to
know
it
seems
curious
in
face
of
such
an
expression
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
and
such
an
epithet
as
hare
brained
applied
to
anything
especially
wild
and
foolhardy
to
find
the
great
bacon
in
his
natural
history
recommending
the
brains
of
hares
as
invaluable
for
strengthening
the
memory
and
brightening
up
the
faculties
those
who
have
frekels
and
would
like
to
get
rid
of
them
should
take
the
bloude
of
an
hare
anoynte
them
with
it
and
it
will
doe
them
awaye
another
eccentric
prescription
is
for
the
benefit
of
sufferers
from
rheumatism
and
if
it
were
only
efficacious
its
simplicity
would
be
a
great
point
in
its
favour
as
it
merely
consists
in
the
carrying
in
the
pocket
of
the
right
fore
foot
of
a
hare
the
only
caution
to
be
exercised
being
that
in
the
case
of
a
man
it
must
be
the
foot
of
a
female
hare
while
a
male
hare
must
supply
the
remedy
if
the
patient
be
a
woman
cogan
in
his
haven
of
health
declares
thus
much
will
i
say
as
to
the
commendation
of
the
hare
and
of
the
defense
of
hunters
toyle
that
no
beast
be
it
never
so
great
is
profitable
to
so
many
and
so
diverse
uses
in
physicke
as
the
hare
and
he
then
proceeds
to
give
numerous
prescriptions
in
which
it
is
the
principal
feature
the
knee
bone
of
an
hare
taken
out
alive
and
worne
abute
the
necke
is
excellent
against
convulsion
fitts
we
are
told
and
perhaps
it
may
be
so
but
the
point
that
more
especially
strikes
us
and
it
impresses
one
over
and
over
again
in
these
medi
val
recipes
is
the
cold
blooded
cruelty
and
indifference
to
animal
suffering
that
is
shown
in
so
many
of
them
fried
mice
were
considered
a
specific
in
small
pox
but
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
fried
alive
while
for
cataract
a
fox
should
be
captured
his
tongue
cut
out
and
the
animal
released
the
member
thus
barbarously
procured
was
placed
in
a
bag
of
red
cloth
and
hung
round
the
man
s
neck
for
erysipelas
a
favourite
old
remedy
was
to
cut
off
one
half
of
the
ear
of
a
cat
and
let
the
blood
drop
on
the
part
affected
while
for
fits
one
popular
recipe
was
to
take
a
mole
alive
cut
the
tip
of
his
nose
off
and
let
nine
drops
of
the
blood
fall
on
to
a
lump
of
sugar
the
swallowing
of
this
was
held
to
be
a
certain
cure
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
these
illustrations
of
atrocious
cruelty
by
the
score
since
one
comes
across
such
barbarities
in
abundance
edward
topsell
in
his
historic
of
foure
footed
beastes
published
in
the
year
discusses
thus
quaintly
and
pleasantly
of
the
hedgehog
it
is
about
the
bignesse
of
a
cony
but
more
like
to
a
hogge
being
beset
and
compassed
all
ouer
with
sharpe
thorney
haires
as
well
on
the
face
as
on
the
feete
when
she
is
angred
or
gathereth
her
foode
she
striketh
them
vp
by
an
admirable
instinct
of
nature
as
sharp
as
pinnes
or
needles
these
are
haire
at
the
beginning
but
afterwards
grow
to
be
prickles
which
is
the
lesse
to
be
maruelled
at
because
there
be
mise
in
egypt
which
haue
haire
like
hedgehogs
his
meate
is
apples
wormes
and
grapes
when
he
findeth
apples
or
grapes
on
the
earth
he
rowleth
himselfe
vppon
them
vntill
he
haue
filled
all
his
prickles
and
then
carrieth
them
home
to
his
den
and
if
it
fortun
that
one
of
them
fall
off
by
the
way
he
likewise
shaketh
off
all
the
residue
and
waloweth
vpon
them
afresh
vntill
they
all
be
settled
vpon
his
backe
againe
so
foorthe
he
goeth
makyng
a
noyse
like
a
cart
wheele
and
if
there
be
any
young
ones
in
his
nest
they
pull
off
his
load
wherewithall
he
is
loaded
eating
thereof
what
they
please
and
laying
uppe
the
residue
for
the
time
to
come
in
the
workes
of
armorie
of
bossewell
published
some
thirty
years
or
so
before
topsell
s
book
we
find
an
account
so
similar
that
we
may
conclude
that
some
one
or
other
wrote
a
sketch
of
the
hedgehog
that
was
considered
so
satisfactory
that
it
became
the
nucleus
for
anybody
else
who
wanted
to
deal
with
the
subject
the
little
hiricion
with
his
sharpe
pykes
is
almost
the
least
of
all
other
beastes
and
of
vs
englishmen
he
is
termed
an
irchin
or
urcheon
a
beast
so
called
for
the
roughness
and
sharpnesse
of
his
pykes
which
nature
hath
giuen
him
in
steade
of
haire
and
such
hys
pykes
couereth
his
skinne
as
the
haire
doth
the
other
beastes
and
be
his
weapon
or
armour
wherewith
he
pricketh
and
greeveth
them
that
take
or
touch
him
he
is
a
beaste
of
witte
and
good
puruciance
for
he
clymeth
vpon
a
vine
or
an
apple
tree
and
biteth
of
their
branches
and
twiggs
and
when
they
be
fallen
doune
he
waloweth
on
them
and
so
they
sticke
to
his
prickles
and
he
beareth
them
into
a
hollow
tree
or
some
other
hole
and
keepeth
them
for
meate
for
himselfe
and
his
young
ones
if
after
he
is
so
charged
there
happe
any
to
fal
from
his
pricks
then
for
indignation
he
throweth
from
his
backe
all
the
other
and
eftsoones
returneth
to
the
tree
to
charge
him
againe
of
newe
these
two
old
authors
both
refer
too
to
the
belief
that
the
hedgehog
had
distinct
gifts
as
a
wind
and
weather
prophet
bossewell
asserts
that
the
urcheon
is
witty
and
wise
in
his
knowledge
of
comming
of
winds
north
and
south
for
he
changeth
his
denne
or
hole
when
he
is
ware
that
such
windes
come
while
topsell
has
it
that
when
they
hide
themselves
in
their
den
they
haue
a
naturall
vnderstanding
of
the
turning
of
the
wind
they
have
two
holes
in
their
caue
the
one
north
the
other
south
obseruing
to
stop
the
mouth
against
the
winde
as
the
skilful
mariner
to
stiere
and
turn
the
rudder
and
sailes
for
which
some
haue
held
opinion
that
they
do
naturally
foreknow
the
change
of
weather
the
hedgehogge
hath
a
sharp
quicke
thorned
garment
that
on
his
backe
doth
serue
him
for
defence
he
can
presage
the
winds
incontinent
and
hath
good
knowledge
in
the
difference
between
the
southerne
and
the
northerne
wind
these
virtues
are
allotted
him
by
kind
whereon
in
constantinople
that
great
city
a
merchant
in
his
garden
gaue
one
nourishment
by
which
he
knew
that
winds
true
certainty
because
the
hedgehog
gaue
him
just
presagement
so
at
all
events
declares
chester
in
his
love
s
martyr
and
bodenham
in
the
belvedere
or
garden
of
the
muses
a
d
testifies
to
the
same
belief
in
the
lines
as
hedgehogs
doe
foresee
ensuinge
stormes
so
wise
men
are
for
fortune
still
prepared
the
author
of
poor
robin
s
almanack
at
the
much
more
recent
date
of
takes
what
one
may
consider
quite
a
professional
interest
in
the
hedgehog
as
a
weather
prophet
and
exclaims
if
by
some
secret
art
the
hedgehog
know
so
long
before
which
way
the
winds
will
blow
she
has
an
art
which
many
a
person
lacks
that
thinks
himself
fit
to
make
almanacks
a
remark
that
is
certainly
most
true
though
for
the
honour
of
the
craft
we
should
hardly
have
expected
a
calendar
maker
to
admit
as
much
the
medicinal
virtues
of
the
hedgehog
were
held
to
be
very
considerable
in
the
days
of
faith
and
some
of
the
preparations
were
abominably
nasty
the
flesh
being
stale
says
one
of
these
old
authorities
giuen
to
a
madde
man
cureth
him
putrid
hedgehog
fetched
out
of
a
ditch
and
given
as
food
or
medicine
to
a
man
the
flesh
salted
dried
beaten
to
a
powder
and
then
drank
in
vinegar
was
held
in
high
repute
as
a
remedy
for
dropsy
and
for
leprosie
the
crampe
and
all
sicknesse
in
the
nerves
and
the
fat
beaten
up
with
honey
was
deemed
an
excellent
strengthener
for
a
weak
voice
topsell
states
that
the
left
eie
of
a
hedgehog
being
fried
with
oyle
yealdeth
a
liquor
which
causeth
sleep
if
it
bee
infused
into
the
eares
with
a
quill
warts
of
al
sorts
are
likewise
taken
away
by
the
same
if
the
right
eie
be
fryed
with
the
oile
of
lineseed
and
put
in
a
vessell
of
red
brasse
and
afterward
anoint
his
eies
therewith
as
with
an
eie
salue
he
shal
see
as
well
in
the
darke
as
in
the
light
the
distinction
is
often
a
very
important
one
in
these
old
recipes
between
left
or
right
hind
leg
or
front
male
or
female
and
the
like
and
an
error
in
any
of
these
details
completely
upsets
all
hope
of
any
benefit
being
derived
thus
we
see
in
this
last
receipt
that
a
man
might
fry
the
left
eye
for
ever
and
never
get
any
nearer
the
gift
of
nocturnal
vision
in
the
same
way
tenne
sprigs
of
laurell
seauen
graines
of
pepper
and
the
skin
of
the
ribs
of
an
hedgehog
dryed
and
beaten
cast
into
three
cups
of
water
and
warmed
so
being
drunk
of
one
that
hath
the
collicke
and
let
rest
he
shall
be
in
perfect
health
but
with
this
exception
that
for
a
man
it
must
bee
the
membrane
of
a
male
hedgehog
and
for
a
woman
a
female
porta
declares
that
the
ancients
made
their
hair
grow
by
using
the
ashes
of
a
land
hedgehog
as
no
one
ever
heard
of
a
water
hedgehog
this
stipulation
seems
almost
needlessly
precise
in
another
recipe
we
are
told
to
take
the
body
of
a
hedgehog
burnt
to
powder
and
if
you
adde
thereto
beares
grease
it
will
restore
unto
a
bald
man
his
heade
of
haire
againe
if
the
place
be
rubbed
vntil
it
be
ready
to
bleed
bear
s
grease
pure
and
simple
has
long
had
a
reputation
amongst
hair
dressers
and
if
this
be
as
potent
as
they
would
have
us
believe
the
rest
of
the
prescription
can
scarcely
claim
much
of
the
credit
the
writer
adds
that
some
mingle
red
snailes
but
this
is
clearly
optional
and
we
should
certainly
avail
ourselves
of
the
option
epilepsy
was
to
be
cured
by
wearing
a
ring
in
which
a
portion
of
the
hoof
of
a
deer
was
enclosed
it
may
interest
anyone
with
a
partiality
for
venison
to
know
that
deer
s
flesh
that
is
catcht
in
summer
is
poyson
because
then
they
feed
on
adders
and
serpents
these
are
venemous
creatures
and
by
eating
of
them
they
grow
thirsty
and
this
they
know
naturally
for
if
they
drink
before
they
have
digested
them
they
are
killed
by
them
wherefore
they
will
abstain
from
water
though
they
burn
with
thirst
wherefore
stag
s
flesh
eaten
at
that
time
is
venemous
and
very
dangerous
shakespeare
refers
to
the
weeping
of
the
deer
and
tells
how
the
big
round
tears
cours
d
one
another
down
his
innocent
nose
in
piteous
chace
it
was
an
old
belief
that
the
deer
wept
every
year
for
the
loss
of
their
horns
a
likeness
of
those
who
grieve
for
the
loss
of
their
worldly
possessions
so
too
should
a
penitent
and
watchful
sinner
not
cease
to
weep
when
he
is
overtaken
this
straining
after
a
moral
as
we
have
already
seen
is
a
very
marked
feature
amongst
the
old
writers
sometimes
the
moral
sentiment
flows
fairly
naturally
but
more
often
it
is
terribly
laboured
thus
for
example
we
read
that
the
ferret
is
a
bold
and
audacious
beast
though
little
and
an
enemie
to
all
other
and
when
they
take
a
prey
their
custome
and
manner
is
onely
to
suck
the
bloud
as
they
bite
it
and
not
to
eat
the
flesh
and
if
at
any
time
their
prey
shall
be
taken
from
them
they
fall
a
squeaking
and
crying
such
are
the
rich
men
of
this
world
who
yell
and
crie
out
when
they
part
with
their
riches
weeping
and
wailing
for
the
losse
of
such
things
as
they
have
hunted
after
with
as
much
greedinesse
as
want
of
pitie
in
like
manner
we
learn
that
when
the
squirrell
is
hunted
she
cannot
be
driven
to
the
ground
unlesse
extremitie
of
faintnesse
cause
her
to
do
so
through
an
unwilling
compulsion
for
such
is
the
stately
mind
of
this
little
beast
that
while
her
limbes
and
strength
lasteth
she
tarrieth
and
saveth
herself
in
the
tops
of
tall
trees
disdaining
to
come
down
for
every
harm
or
hurt
which
she
feeleth
knowing
indeed
her
greatest
danger
to
rest
below
amongst
the
dogs
and
busie
hunters
from
whence
may
be
gathered
a
perfect
pattern
for
us
to
be
secured
from
all
the
wiles
and
hungrie
chasings
of
the
treacherous
devil
namely
that
we
keep
above
in
the
loftie
palaces
of
heavenlie
meditations
for
there
is
small
securitie
in
things
on
earth
and
greatest
ought
to
be
our
fear

we

the
fabulists
and
moralists
of
ancient
and
medi
val
days
regarded
animals
as
so
much
raw
material
to
be
modelled
into
whatever
form
best
suited
their
ends
they
were
little
if
at
all
concerned
in
giving
a
true
picture
of
animal
life
but
used
the
various
creatures
in
such
conventional
and
allegorical
way
as
most
readily
adapted
itself
to
the
moral
or
political
end
in
view
in
their
writings
art
has
often
pursued
much
the
same
course
and
instead
of
giving
us
the
real
animal
nature
has
introduced
an
entirely
foreign
element
and
represented
the
creatures
as
swayed
by
purely
human
considerations
sop
and
la
fontaine
make
the
animals
speak
as
though
they
were
influenced
by
human
feelings
and
motives
while
landseer
for
example
in
some
of
his
noble
pictures
employs
his
dogs
and
other
animals
to
simulate
humanity
as
in
laying
down
the
law
alexander
and
diogenes
and
other
well
known
works
of
the
master
the
result
is
quaint
grotesque
delicious
humorous
but
these
law
givers
philosophers
and
so
forth
are
canine
in
form
alone
and
are
but
puppets
acting
a
part
that
is
a
good
natured
satire
on
humanity
it
was
a
very
old
belief
that
when
the
wild
boar
was
hunted
its
tusks
grew
so
hot
in
its
rage
and
excitement
as
to
actually
burn
the
dogs
if
they
came
within
the
terrible
sweep
of
them
xenophon
tells
us
in
his
description
of
the
chase
of
the
boar
that
hairs
laid
upon
the
tusks
shrivel
up
even
after
the
brute
is
slain
this
belief
has
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
of
writers
on
so
called
natural
history
and
even
in
a
book
in
our
possession
published
in
london
in
we
find
the
statement
only
very
slightly
qualified
by
a
preliminary
it
is
said
it
is
said
that
when
this
creature
is
hunted
down
his
tusks
are
so
inflamed
that
they
will
burn
and
singe
the
hair
of
the
dogs
shakespeare
says
that
the
ireful
boar
does
not
even
fear
the
lion
and
guillim
says
that
he
is
counted
the
most
absolute
champion
amongst
beasts
for
that
he
hath
weapons
to
wound
his
foe
which
are
his
strong
and
sharp
tusks
and
also
his
target
to
defend
himself
for
which
he
useth
oft
to
rub
his
shoulders
and
sides
against
trees
wherewith
to
harden
them
against
the
stroke
of
his
adversary
herbert
states
in
his
book
of
travels
that
there
are
on
the
african
coast
opposite
madagascar
vast
herds
of
wild
swine
that
are
greatly
esteemed
by
the
natives
of
those
parts
not
only
for
their
flesh
but
more
especially
for
a
stone
that
is
found
often
within
them
which
is
very
soveraign
against
poison
the
spaniards
he
tells
us
call
it
pietro
del
porco
the
virtue
of
this
stone
is
supposed
to
arise
from
their
feeding
upon
certain
medical
herbs
the
ermine
was
believed
to
prefer
death
to
defilement
and
if
placed
within
a
wall
or
ring
of
mud
would
kill
itself
rather
than
contaminate
its
spotless
fur
it
is
on
this
account
that
ermine
is
selected
as
the
robe
of
prince
and
judge
an
emblem
of
unspotted
purity
beaumont
and
fletcher
in
their
knight
of
malta
refer
to
this
in
the
line
whose
honour
ermine
like
can
never
suffer
spot
in
a
portrait
of
queen
elizabeth
at
hatfield
an
ermine
is
represented
as
running
up
her
arm
as
a
delicate
compliment
to
the
virgin
queen
it
was
reported
that
goats
see
as
well
by
night
as
by
day
hence
those
people
who
are
unable
to
see
after
dark
can
be
cured
of
their
infirmity
by
eating
the
liver
of
a
goat
while
for
those
who
suffered
from
insomnia
no
remedy
was
held
in
better
repute
than
the
horn
of
a
goat
this
placed
beneath
the
head
of
the
patient
speedily
brought
refreshing
sleep
porta
affirms
that
goats
when
their
eyes
are
blood
shotten
let
out
the
blood
the
she
goat
by
the
point
of
a
bullrush
the
he
goat
by
the
pricking
of
a
thorn
such
examples
of
animal
sagacity
have
a
great
attraction
for
this
old
author
and
he
gives
many
instances
in
support
of
his
contention
that
living
creatures
though
they
have
no
understanding
yet
their
senses
are
quicker
than
ours
and
by
their
actions
they
teach
us
physick
husbandry
the
art
of
building
the
disposing
of
household
affairs
and
almost
all
arts
and
sciences
the
beasts
that
have
no
reason
do
by
their
nature
strangely
shun
the
eyes
of
witches
and
hurtfull
things
the
doves
for
a
preservative
against
inchantment
first
gather
some
little
bay
tree
boughs
and
then
lay
them
upon
their
nests
to
preserve
their
young
so
do
the
kites
use
brambles
the
turtles
swordgrasse
the
crows
withy
the
lapwings
venus

the
ravens
ivy
the
herns
carrot
the
blackbirds
myrtle
the
larkes
grasse
for
the
same
purpose
in
lyke
manner
they
have
shewed
us
preservatives
against
poysons
the
elephant
having
by
chance
eaten
a
chameleon
against
the
poyson
thereof
eats
of
the
wilde
olive
the
tortoise

serpent
dispels
the

eating
the

origan
there
is
a
kind
of
spider
which
destroyeth
the
harts
except
permitting
they
eat
wilde
ivy
and
whensoever
they
light
upon
any
poysonous
food
they
cure
themselves
with
the
artichoke
and
against
serpents
they
prepare
and
arm
themselves
with
wilde
parsneps
we
need
not
further
pursue
matters
with
our
author
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
brings
forward
an
enormous
number
of
examples
and
amply
proves
his
case
to
his
satisfaction
as
indeed
he
should
have
no
difficulty
in
doing
when
it
is
once
understood
that
facts
are
of
secondary
importance
one
strange
notion
of
antiquity
was
that
the
blood
of
the
goat
would
dissolve
the
diamond
the
statement
is
found
in
pliny
solinus
albertus
cyprian
isidore
and
many
other
writers
right
away
down
to
comparatively
recent
days
legh
for
instance
states
without
hesitation
the
diamonde
which
neither
iron
nor
fier
wil
daunt
the
bloud
of
the
gote
softneth
to
the
breaking
maundevile
of
course
receives
it
as
an
undoubted
truth
while
even
browne
writes
we
hear
it
in
every
mouth
and
in
many
good
authors
reade
it
that
a
diamond
which
is
the
hardest
of
stones
not
yeelding
unto
steele
emery
or
any
other
thing
is
yet
made
soft
and
broke
by
the
bloud
of
a
goat
that
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
must
have
been
a
mere
truism
in
the
middle
ages
thus
aubrey
in
his
remains
of
gentilisme
and
judaism
introduces
the
goat
in
an
entirely
new
character
a
conceit
there
is
that
ye
devil
commonly
appeareth
with
a
cloven
hoof
wherein
though
it
seem
excessively
ridiculous
there
may
be
something
of
truth
and
ye
ground
at
first
might
be
his
frequent
appearing
in
the
shape
of
a
goat
which
answers
that
description
this
was
the
opinion
of
ancient
xtians
concerning
ye
apparition
of
fauns
and
satyrs
the
devil
most
often
appears
in
the
shape
of
a
goat
nor
did
he
only
assume
this
shape
in
olden
times
but
commonly
in
later
times
especially
in
ye
place
of
his
worship
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
confession
of
witches
and
therefore
a
goat
is
not
improperly
made
an
hieroglyphic
of
ye
devil
the
shrew
mouse
one
of
the
most
inoffensive
of
creatures
was
by
our
ancestors
held
to
be
of
terribly
poisonous
nature
its
bite
was
thought
to
be
most
venomous
and
even
contact
with
it
in
any
way
was
accounted
extremely
dangerous
cattle
and
horses
seized
with
any
malady
that
appeared
to
cause
any
numbness
of
the
legs
were
at
once
reputed
shrew
struck
it
is
a
ravening
beast
quoth
topsell
feigning
itself
gentle
and
tame
but
being
touched
it
biteth
deep
and
poysoneth
deadly
it
beareth
a
cruel
minde
desiring
to
hunt
anything
neither
is
there
any
creature
that
it
loveth
on
whatever
limb
it
crept
was
cruel
anguish
often
ending
in
paralysis
these
calumnies
have
prevailed
in
many
countries
and
for
many
ages
the
romans
being
as
firmly
convinced
of
the
deadly
nature
of
the
shrew
mouse
as
any
british
rustic
of
a
century
ago
the
shrew
mouse
according
to
the
author
of
the
speculum
mundi
hath
a
long
and
sharp
snout
like
a
mole
in
latine
it
is
called
mus
araneus
because
it
containeth
in
it
poison
or
venime
like
a
spider
and
if
at
any
time
it
bite
either
man
or
beast
the
truth
of
this
will
be
too
apparent
but
commonly
it
is
called
a
shrew
mouse
and
from
the
venimous
biting
of
this
beast
we
have
an
english
imprecation
i
beshrew
thee
in
which
words
we
do
indeed
wish
some
such
evil
and
again
because
a
curst
scold
or
brawling
wife
is
esteemed
none
of
the
least
evils
we
therefore
call
such
a
one
a
shrew
hence
shakespeare
dealing
with
such
a
character
entitled
one
of
his
plays
the
taming
of
the
shrew
happily
there
was
a
certain
antidote
against
the
evil
wrought
by
this
malevolent
beast
a
large
ash
tree
being
chosen
a
deep
hole
was
made
in
its
trunk
and
after
certain
incantations
were
made
a
shrew
mouse
was
thrust
alive
into
the
opening
and
the
hole
securely
plugged
a
shrew
ash
says
gilbert
white
in
his
natural
history
of
selborne
is
an
ash
whose
twigs
or
branches
when
gently
applied
to
the
limbs
of
cattle
will
immediately
relieve
the
pain
which
a
beast
suffers
from
the
running
of
a
shrew
mouse
over
the
part
affected
against
this
accident
to
which
they
were
continually
liable
our
provident
forefathers
always
kept
a
shrew
ash
at
hand
which
when
once
medicated
would
maintain
its
virtue
for
ever
one
of
these
shrew
ashes
now
but
a
fragment
of
what
was
evidently
once
a
massive
stately
tree
may
still
be
seen
near
the
sheen
gate
in
richmond
park
and
there
are
those
still
living
who
can
remember
cattle
and
horses
being
brought
to
it
for
its
healing
virtues
the
horse
does
not
seem
to
have
so
much
unnatural
history
associated
with
him
as
we
might
have
anticipated
such
stories
as
that
of
the
feeding
of
the
horses
of
diomed
with
human
flesh
or
of
the
milk
white
steed
al
borak
of
mohammed
each
of
whose
strides
was
equal
to
the
furthest
range
of
human
vision
being
altogether
fabulous
and
mythical
diomed
the
tyrant
of
thrace
seems
to
have
held
out
very
little
encouragement
to
immigrants
or
wandering
tourists
if
the
legend
be
true
that
he
utilized
them
as
fodder
here
such
dire
welcome
is
for
thee
prepared
as
diomed
s
unhappy
strangers
shared
his
hapless
guests
at
silent
midnight
bled
on
their
torn
limbs
his
snorting
coursers
fed
one
meets
with
many
famous
steeds
in
classical
and
medi
val
literature
but
these
of
course
are
individual
examples
of
the
race
and
anything
told
of
them
can
scarcely
be
considered
as
testifying
to
the
general
though
erroneous
notions
entertained
on
the
subject
of
horses
generally
the
horse
bayard
for
example
the
property
of
the
four
sons
of
aymon
had
a
most
useful
peculiarity
in
that
he
grew
larger
or
smaller
in
fair
proportion
to
his
rider
according
as
the
big
stalwart
brother
of
six
feet
high
or
the
little
fellow
not
yet
in
his
teens
got
astride
him
one
of
the
horses
of
achilles
is
said
to
have
announced
to
his
master
his
impending
death
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
expanding
contracting
and
talkative
horses
are
altogether
outside
the
ordinary
pale
according
to
a
small
manuscript
of
the
twelfth
century
called
mapp
clavicula
if
oxen
drink
first
then
there
will
be
enough
water
for
both
oxen
and
horses
but
if
the
horses
drink
first
there
will
not
be
sufficient
either
for
horses
or
oxen
horses
are
afraid
of
elephants
until
they
get
used
to
them
and
there
is
also
some
little
antipathy
between
camels
bears
and
horses
porta
declares
that
horses
will
burst
if
they
tread
upon
the
wolf
s
footing
if
drums
be
made
of
an
elephant
camel
or
wolves
skin
and
one
beat
them
the
horses
will
then
run
away
and
dare
not
stand
by
the
same
reason
if
you
will
drive
away
bears
a
horse
hath
a
capital
hatred
with
a
bear
he
will
know
his
enemy
that
he
never
saw
before
and
presentlie
provide
himself
to
fight
with
him
and
i
have
heard
that
bears
have
been
driven
away
in
the
wildernesse
by
the
sound
of
a
drum
when
it
was
made
of
horse
s
skin
it
has
for
centuries
been
a
belief
in
many
parts
of
the
country
that
the
hairs
from
a
horse
s
tail
when
dropped
in
the
water
become
endued
with
life
and
turn
into
small
eels
a
horsehair
tied
round
a
wart
has
been
held
to
be
of
potent
efficacy
for
its
removal
and
horsehair
spread
on
bread
and
butter
has
been
prescribed
as
a
remedy
even
in
quite
recent
times
for
worms
for
sciatica
according
to
one
dr
floyer
once
on
a
time
one
of
the
shining
lights
of
the
medical
profession
the
finest
preparation
is
the
marrow
of
a
horse
kill
d
by
chance
not
dying
of
any
disease
mixed
with
some
rose
water
chafe
it
in
with
a
warme
hand
for
a
quarter
of
an
houre
then
putt
on
a
scarlett
cloth
broad
enough
to
cover
ye
part
affected
and
go
into
a
warme
bed
as
personal
experience
is
so
valuable
in
all
such
cases
he
adds
it
cured
my
aunt
lakes
who
went
yearly
to
the
bath
for
ye
sciatica
but
never
went
after
she
knew
and
used
this
medicine
in
winstanley
s
book
of
knowledge
a
book
that
went
through
several
editions
our
copy
we
see
is
dated
he
deals
with
many
strange
matters
and
gives
receipts
for
various
extraordinary
requirements
to
make
men
seem
headless
to
make
it
that
men
shall
not
find
the
door
and
so
forth
but
amongst
rather
more
reasonable
items
we
find
to
make
one
dance
the
modus
operandi
is
sufficiently
simple
though
perhaps
a
trifle
disgusting
it
is
as
follows
cut
the
hoof
of
a
horse
in
pieces
seethe
it
with
oyl
and
anoint
the
table
or
any
other
place
and
lay
his
head
thereon
when
you
would
have
him
to
dance
such
is
a
sample
of
the
best
that
this
storehouse
of
knowledge
could
yield
to
those
who
sought
its
help
horse
shoes
were
at
one
time
often
nailed
on
doors
as
a
protection
against
witches
and
malignant
spirits
and
the
horse
shoe
nailed
each
threshold
s
guard
may
often
still
be
seen
on
old
country
houses
john
aubrey
writing
some
two
hundred
years
ago
says
most
houses
at
the
west
end
of
london
have
a
horse
shoe
on
the
threshold
dwellers
in
town
however
have
not
the
same
dread
of
the
mysterious
as
the
more
lonely
dwellers
in
the
country
though
many
a
man
who
is
brave
enough
on
the
gas
lighted
pavement
would
feel
a
little
creepy
when
the
shrill
scream
of
a
trapped
hare
or
the
wild
cry
of
the
peewit
broke
upon
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
found
him
in
some
country
lane
or
on
the
open
downland
it
is
a
firm
article
of
belief
however
with
all
who
have
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
the
horse
shoe
that
it
must
be
picked
up
not
bought
whatever
virtue
may
reside
in
one
that
is
found
is
wholly
wanting
in
one
that
is
purchased
the
humble
donkey
has
its
share
of
quaint
associations
the
conspicuous
cross
upon
its
back
is
popularly
supposed
to
date
from
the
day
that
our
saviour
rode
in
jerusalem
upon
an
ass
it
is
however
more
probable
that
the
ass
that
brayed
and
browsed
in
eden
bore
a
similar
mark
amongst
the
ancient
egyptians
the
ass
was
dedicated
to
the
evil
spirit
typho
and
once
a
year
if
we
may
believe
plutarch
the
people
sacrificed
an
ass
to
this
foul
deity
by
hurling
it
over
a
precipice
the
people
of
lycopolis
carried
their
antipathy
so
far
that
they
excluded
the
trumpet
from
their
festivals
and
military
service
from
a
fancy
that
its
sound
was
a
little
too
suggestive
of
the
asinine
vocal
performances
the
asses
of
the
east
are
of
a
more
tawny
colour
than
those
with
which
we
are
familiar
in
england
as
this
red
tint
was
associated
in
people
s
minds
with
a
creature
devoted
to
the
evil
one
it
was
but
a
step
further
to
ascribe
an
evil
association
to
the
colour
itself
hence
anyone
who
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
an
especially
ruddy
countenance
or
a
more
than
usually
deep
shade
of
red
in
the
hair
was
at
once
held
to
be
in
an
uncomfortably
close
relationship
with
typho
the
dun
colour
of
our
british
specimens
gave
them
their
name
chaucer
for
instance
calls
the
donkey
the
dun
as
we
may
see
in
the
canterbury
tales
dun
is
in
the
mire
according
to
de
thaun
the
wild
ass
when
march
in
its
course
has
completed
twenty
five
days
brays
twelve
times
and
also
in
the
night
for
this
reason
that
that
season
is
the
equinox
days
and
nights
are
of
equal
length
by
the
twelve
times
that
it
makes
its
braying
and
crying
it
shows
that
night
and
day
have
twelve
hours
in
their
circuit
the
ass
is
grieved
when
he
makes
his
cry
that
the
night
and
the
day
have
equal
length
for
he
likes
better
the
length
of
the
night
than
of
the
day
one
can
only
read
such
an
extract
as
this
with
a
feeling
of
utter
wonder
in
the
first
place
how
de
thaun
could
believe
such
a
thing
himself
and
in
the
second
place
how
he
could
expect
anyone
else
to
do
so
the
exact
accuracy
of
the
wild
ass
as
to
the
day
of
the
month
and
his
twelvefold
bray
of
regret
as
each
recurring
year
brings
it
round
again
are
triumphs
of
the
imaginative
faculty
we
may
probably
infer
that
when
the
twenty
ninth
day
of
september
has
come
round
again
the
balance
is
redressed
hope
springs
again
and
the
twelve
brays
this
time
are
of
a
peculiarly
jubilant
and
sonorous
character
asses
hair
was
in
the
middle
ages
held
to
be
a
sterling
remedy
for
ague
though
one
must
have
been
credulous
indeed
to
try
it
it
is
interesting
more
especially
perhaps
as
a
foreshadowing
of
that
doctrine
of
hom
opathy
which
deals
with
the
cure
of
like
by
like
great
healing
powers
are
attributed
to
the
hairs
from
the
cross
on
the
donkey
s
back
hairs
cut
from
it
and
suspended
in
a
bag
round
a
child
s
neck
were
a
potent
influence
in
the
prevention
of
fits
and
convulsions
another
famous
remedy
was
the
cure
of
whooping
cough
by
passing
the
sufferer
three
times
under
the
belly
and
three
times
over
the
back
of
a
donkey
in
sussex
a
standard
remedy
for
the
same
distressing
complaint
was
procured
by
cutting
some
of
the
hair
out
of
the
cross
chopping
it
up
finely
and
spreading
it
on
bread
and
butter
for
the
breakfast
of
the
patient
while
in
dorsetshire
prevention
was
rightly
considered
better
than
cure
and
though
the
rustics
may
have
doubted
the
efficacy
of
vaccination
as
a
remedy
against
small
pox
they
had
no
hesitation
whatever
in
getting
their
children
astride
on
the
donkey
s
back
as
early
as
possible
as
a
preventative
to
their
ever
catching
whooping
cough
one
meets
with
remedy
after
remedy
of
the
same
general
nature
and
all
owing
their
efficacy
to
some
mysterious
connection
between
this
particular
complaint
and
donkey
hair
but
what
this
occult
influence
can
be
is
wholly
unknown
to
us
the
old
herald
legh
says
of
the
ass
as
he
is
not
the
wisest
so
is
he
the
least
sumptuous
especially
in
his
diet
for
his
feeding
is
on
thistles
nettles
and
briers
and
therefore
small
birdes
hate
him
especially
the
sparrowe
is
most
enemie
unto
him
as
they
see
him
stolidly
devouring
the
plants
that
they
visit
for
their
own
sustenance
the
ancient
author
with
ponderous
humour
finishes
his
account
of
the
ass
by
saying
i
could
write
much
of
this
beast
but
that
it
wolde
be
thought
it
were
to
mine
owne
glorie
the
dog
the
friend
and
companion
of
man
was
said
to
see
ghosts
and
their
howling
at
untoward
times
portended
death
or
conflagration
or
some
such
grave
event
and
has
therefore
for
many
centuries
been
held
of
evil
omen
and
no
doubt
in
remote
country
districts
the
feeling
still
remains
the
cries
were
said
to
be
often
in
terror
of
sights
invisible
to
man
rabbi
menachem
declares
in
his
exposition
of
the
pentateuch
that
when
the
angel
of
death
enters
into
a
city
the
dogs
do
howl
and
he
records
an
instance
of
a
dog
that
fled
in
terror
from
before
the
angel
and
that
someone
kicked
it
back
and
it
died
but
whether
from
the
effects
of
a
too
vigorous
kick
or
from
being
thrust
into
the
path
of
the
destroying
angel
he
does
not
venture
to
pronounce
if
a
child
has
whooping
cough
some
of
its
hair
must
be
placed
between
slices
of
bread
and
given
to
a
dog
should
the
dog
cough
as
he
most
probably
will
it
is
an
indication
that
the
disease
has
passed
from
the
child
to
the
dog
the
same
idea
may
be
seen
in
the
old
custom
of
giving
some
of
the
hair
of
anyone
attacked
with
scarlet
fever
to
a
donkey
should
the
animal
swallow
it
the
disease
was
supposed
then
and
there
to
pass
from
the
one
ass
to
the
other
coles
in
his
art
of
simpling
says
that
the
herb
called
hound
s
tongue
will
tye
the
tongues
of
houndes
so
that
they
shall
not
bark
at
you
if
it
be
laid
under
the
bottom
of
your
foot
a
little
hare
s
fur
somewhere
about
the
person
was
held
to
be
equally
valuable
and
no
doubt
it
was
one
authority
hath
it
that
a
dog
will
not
bark
if
another
dog
s
tongue
be
carried
under
the
great
toe
and
the
carrying
of
a
dog
s
heart
in
one
s
pocket
is
another
capital
idea
to
the
same
end
the
tail
of
a
young
wheezel
put
under
your
foot
is
also
recommended
and
if
none
of
these
methods
are
available
the
dog
may
be
equally
well
silenced
by
giving
him
a
frog
to
eat
artfully
secreted
in
a
piece
of
meat
during
the
middle
ages
it
was
held
that
the
head
of
a
mad
dog
pounded
up
and
drank
in
wine
was
a
specific
for
jaundice
if
on
the
other
hand
the
head
was
burnt
and
the
powdered
ashes
put
to
a
cancer
it
was
held
a
sure
remedy
and
naturally
on
the
hom
opathic
principle
of
like
to
like
these
ashes
if
given
to
a
man
who
had
been
bitten
by
a
rabid
dog
casteth
out
all
the
venom
and
the
foulness
and
healeth
the
maddening
bites
the
liver
of
the
dog
was
equally
efficacious
a
gipsy
preventative
of
hydrophobia
was
to
take
some
hairs
from
the
dog
that
gave
the
bite
a
very
risky
operation
by
the
way
and
fry
them
in
oil
applying
them
with
a
little
green
rosemary
to
the
wound
to
eat
churchyard
grass
was
esteemed
also
a
good
thing
in
the
case
of
anyone
bitten
by
a
rabid
dog
so
lately
as
the
year
it
came
out
at
the
inquest
held
on
the
body
of
a
child
that
had
died
of
hydrophobia
that
one
of
the
relatives
fished
up
out
of
the
river
the
dead
body
of
the
dog
that
had
done
the
mischief
in
order
that
its
liver
might
be
cooked
and
eaten
by
the
child
in
spite
of
this
the
patient
died
it
was
held
that
if
a
cat
were
in
a
cart
a
state
of
things
that
need
rarely
happen
one
would
imagine
the
horses
would
soon
tire
if
the
wind
blew
from
pussy
to
them
and
that
in
like
manner
the
steed
would
soon
flag
that
was
ridden
by
a
man
who
had
any
cat
s
fur
in
his
dress
and
that
anyone
swallowing
the
hair
of
a
cat
would
be
subject
to
fainting
fits
on
the
other
hand
it
was
believed
that
nothing
was
better
as
a
cure
for
whitlow
than
to
put
the
ailing
finger
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
each
day
into
the
ear
of
a
cat
anything
that
touches
a
cat
s
ear
is
received
with
such
marked
disfavour
that
we
imagine
this
remedy
is
simply
unworkable
as
the
cat
would
never
be
a
consenting
party
three
drops
of
blood
from
a
cat
s
tail
were
held
to
be
a
cure
for
epilepsy
while
a
sovereign
remedy
for
those
who
would
preserve
their
sight
was
to
burn
the
head
of
a
black
cat
to
ashes
and
then
blow
a
little
of
the
dust
three
times
a
day
into
the
eyes
this
we
imagine
should
rather
be
classed
amongst
the
methods
of
injuring
the
sight
to
cure
a
stye
our
forefathers
had
great
faith
in
rubbing
it
with
hairs
from
a
cat
s
tail
two
essential
points
being
that
the
cat
should
be
a
black
one
and
that
the
operation
should
take
place
on
the
first
night
of
the
new
moon
but
to
cure
warts
the
hairs
must
be
taken
from
the
tail
of
a
tortoiseshell
cat
and
even
then
the
remedy
is
only
efficacious
during
the
month
of
may
another
strange
belief
was
that
a
cat
having
three
colours
in
its
fur
was
a
great
protection
against
fire
it
is
an
old
idea
that
the
brains
of
cats
are
of
destructive
malignity
and
that
anyone
desiring
to
quietly
get
rid
of
an
enemy
has
only
to
invite
him
to
a
repast
in
which
some
of
the
delicacies
have
an
imperceptible
fragment
of
this
poison
added
cats
see
well
by
night
and
were
often
and
especially
black
ones
believed
to
be
the
witches
familiars
and
therefore
regarded
with
fear
and
aversion
it
was
held
that
they
had
power
to
raise
a
gale
and
on
board
ship
the
malevolent
disposition
with
which
they
were
credited
has
made
them
in
an
especial
degree
unpopular

pussy
was
thought
to
particularly
provoke
a
storm
by
playing
with
any
article
of
wearing
apparel
by
rubbing
her
face
or
by
licking
her
fur
the
wrong
way
she
was
sheltered
from
rough
usage
however
by
the
belief
that
provoking
her
would
bring
a
gale
while
drowning
her
would
cause
a
regular
tempest
in
germany
there
is
a
belief
that
anyone
who
makes
a
cat
his
enemy
will
be
attended
at
his
funeral
by
rats
and
heavy
rain
as
cats
see
well
by
night
and
are
given
to
wandering
abroad
at
unholy
hours
they
were
connected
with
the
baleful
influences
of
the
moon
freye
the
norse
goddess
was
attended
by
cats
and
friday
her
especial
day
was
always
considered
unlucky
the
ruffling
of
the
water
by
the
rising
wind
is
called
a
cat
s
paw
and
cats
are
said
to
smell
a
coming
gale
while
all
must
be
familiar
with
that
tempestuous
state
of
affairs
known
as
raining
cats
and
dogs
in
cornwall
and
on
some
other
parts
of
the
coast
the
people
say
that
a
spectral
dog
called
shony
is
sometimes
seen
and
that
this
always
predicts
a
storm
some
persons
have
a
marked
antipathy
to
cats

some
that

mad
if
they
behold
a

it
is
well
known
that
cats
have
a
wonderful
knack
of
falling
on
their
feet
and
they
are
so
tenacious
of
life
that
they
are
ordinarily
credited
with
having
nine
lives
though
it
is
proverbially
held
that
care
will
kill

a

refer
to
cat
lore
in

i
the
adage

in

this
old
belief
in

strong
hold

distinctly
referred

the

again
appears
in
the
legend
of
the
indomitable
cats
of
kilkenny
that
fought
till
a
little
fluff
was
all
the
record
of
that
sanguinary
struggle
and
we

all

heard
of
the
special

of
the

the

of

was
one
of

the
reputed
companion
of

unlovely
and
unloved
personages

therefore
receives
this
name
aubrey
writing
in
tells
a
story
that
smacks
strongly
of
witchcraft
and
the
black
cat
mrs
clarke
a
herefordshire
woman
told
me
he
says
to
bury
the
head
of
a
black
catt
with
a
jacobus
or
a
piece
of
gold
in
it
and
put
into
the
eies
two
black
beanes
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
beanes
she
hath
forgott
but
it
must
be
done
on
a
tuesday
at
twelve
o
clock
at
night
and
that
time
nine
nights
after
the
piece
of
gold
must
be
taken
out
and
whatsoever
you
buy
with
it
always
reserving
some
part
of
the
money
you
will
have
money
brought
into
your
pockett
perhaps
the
same
piece
of
gold
again
unfortunately
he
does
not
seem
to
have
tried
it
so
we
never
learn
what
success
might
have
attended
the
experiment
the
description
of
pussy
by
bartholomew
anglicus
is
most
graphic
and
is
an
evident
study
from
the
life
he
is
a
full
lecherous
beast
in
youth
saith
he
swift
pliant
and
merry
and
leapeth
and
reseth
on
everything
that
is
afore
him
and
is
led
by
a
straw
and
played
therewith
and
is
a
right
heavy
beast
in
age
and
full
sleepy
and
lieth
slyly
in
wait
for
mice
and
is
aware
where
they
be
more
by
smell
than
by
sight
and
hunteth
and
reseth
on
them
in
privy
places
and
when
he
taketh
a
mouse
he
playeth
therewith
and
eateth
him
after
the
play
in
time
of
love
is
hard
fighting
for
wives
and
one
scratcheth
and
rendeth
the
other
grievously
with
biting
and
with
claws
and
he
maketh
a
rueful
noyse
and
ghastful
when
one
proffereth
to
fight
with
another
and
hardly
is
he
hurt
when
he
is
thrown
down
off
an
high
place
and
when
he
hath
a
fair
skin
he
is
as
it
were
proud
thereof
and
goeth
fast
about
and
is
oft
for
his
fair
skin
taken
of
the
skinner
and
slain
and
flayed
this
is
clearly
the
description
of
a
close
and
accurate
observer
the
description
in
the
speculum
mundi
though
much
shorter
is
almost
equally
happy
the
common
or
vulgar
cat
is
a
creature
well
known
and
being
young
it
is
very
wanton
and
sportfull
but
waxing
older
is
very
sad
and
melancholy
it
is
called
a
cat
from
the
latine
word
signifying
wary
for
a
cat
is
a
watchfull
and
warie
beast
seldome
overtaken
and
most
attendant
to
her
sport
and
prey
john
bossewell
says
of
the
cat
that
he
is
slie
and
wittie
and
seeth
so
sharply
that
he
overcommeth
darknesse
of
the
nyghte
by
the
shynynge
lyghte
of
his

he
doth
delighte
that
he
enjoyeth
his
libertie
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
but
cat
nature
is
evidently
unchanging
cats
naturally
suggest
rats
and
mice
it
was
an
ancient
belief
that
these
sprang
spontaneously
from
any
mass
of
putrefaction
mice
excell
all
living
creatures
writes
one
of
the
ancient
authorities
in
the
knowledge

of
things
to
come
for
when
any
old
house
habitation
tenement
or
other
dwelling
place
waxeth
ruinous
and
ready
to
fall
they
perceive
it
first
and
out
of
that
their

they
make
present
avoidance
from
their
holes
and
betake
themselves
to

give
them

and
so
they
seek
some
other

wherein

may

with

securitie
our
readers
will
naturally
recall
the
proverbial
belief
that
rats
desert
the
sinking
ship
swift
in
his
epistle
to
mr
nugent
writes
of
those
that
fly
like
rats
from
sinking
ships
and
the
desertion
of
the
losing
side
has
received
the
opprobrious
name
of
ratting
on
this
account
maundevile
amongst
many
other
wonderful
things
that
he
saw
or
heard
of
in
his
travels
came
to
a
place
where
the
rats
were
as
large
as
dogs
requiring
great
mastiffs
for
their
capture
as
they
were
altogether
beyond
the
power
of
the
cats
of
the
place
to
deal
with
and
ther
ben
myse
als
grete
as
houndes
and
yalowe
myse
als
grete
as
ravennes
if
the
rats
and
mice
kept
the
proportion
between
their
respective
sizes
that
we
are
familiar
with
and
the
mice
were
as
big
as
hounds
we
can
readily
understand
that
the
rats
must
have
been
very
formidable
creatures
indeed
and
quite
beyond
the
power
of
ordinary
terrier
or
pussy
to
cope
with
jordanus
brought
home
a
story
of
rats
in
india
as
large
as
foxes
the
creatures
he
saw
were
probably
bandicoots
very
rat
like
animals
though
not
quite
so
big
as
foxes
even
though
the
indian
foxes
are
much
smaller
than
the
species
we
have
in
england
a
bandicoot
is
about
twenty
one
inches
long
full
measure
about
five
inches
of
this
being
tail
according
to
herodotus
it
was
not
the
rats
that
were
equal
in
size
to
foxes
in
india
but
the
ants
we
can
recall
an
absurd
picture
of
these
in
one
of
the
medi
val
natural
history
books
where
a
couple
of
europeans
stand
at
a
very
respectful
distance
from
a
large
mound
that
is
covered
with
ants
as
big
as
cats
the
effect
of
the
ant
form
when
thus
magnified
being
very
quaint
it
was
a
very
ancient
belief
that
oysters
mussels
cockles
and
all
shell
fishes
grew
or
diminished
according
to
the
phases
of
the
moon
some
have
found
it
out
by
diligent
search
that
the
fibres
in
the
livers
of
rats
and
mice
answer
in
number
to
the
days
of
the
month
s
age
this
was
really
a
very
curious
discovery
to
make
or
shall
we
rather
say
a
very
curious
assertion
to
be
responsible
for
it
is
impossible
to
mention
a
tithe
of
the
strange
facts
got
together
by
the
industry
of
the
men
of
science
of
the
past
sometimes
introducing
to
our
notice
the
most
extraordinary
creatures
at
others
presenting
the
most
ordinary
creatures
in
an
extraordinary
way
what
can
we
say
for
instance
of
the
catoblepas
a
beast
bred
in
lybia
a
fearful
and
terrible
beast
to
look
upon
his
eyes
very
fierie
as
it
were
of
a
bloudie
colour
and
he
never
useth
to
look
directly
forward
nor
upward
but
always
down
to
the
earth
he
has
a
long
mane
and
cloven
feet
and
his
body
covered
with
scales
as
for
his
meat
it
is
deadly
and
poysonfull
herbes
and
he
sendeth
forth
a
horrible
breath
which
poysoneth
the
aire
over
his
head
and
about
him
inasmuch
that
such
creatures
as
draw
in
the
breath
of
that
aire
are
grievously
afflicted
and
losing
both
voice
and
sight
they
fall
into
deadly
convulsions
what
shall
we
say
of
the
oryges
the
only
beast
in
creation
that
has
his
hair
growing
reversed
and
turning
towards
the
head
or
of
the
lomie
in
the
forests
of
bohemia
which
hath
hanging
under
its
neck
a
bladder
always
full
of
scalding
water
with
which
when
she
is
hunted
she
so
tortureth
the
dogs
that
she
thereby
maketh
her
escape
or
of
the
wonderful
eale
of
ethiopia
as
large
as
a
hippopotamus
and
having
horns
that
he
can
incline
backwards
or
forwards
at
any
angle
to
suit
the
exigencies
of
conflict
or
of
the
manticora
having
the
face
of
a
man
and
the
body
of
a
lion
and
voice
like
the
blending
of
flute
and
of
trumpet
or
of
fifty
other
creatures
equally
extraordinary
it
is
painful
to
think
that
such
stories
were
deliberate
inventions
and
that
knaves
devised
them
and
fools
accepted
them
and
we
must
we
believe
conclude
that
almost
every
story
had
a
grain
of
truth
in
it
but
that
the
love
of
the
marvellous
the
tendency
to
exaggeration
the
change
that
took
place
as
the
story
travelled
and
received
almost
unconsciously
here
an
additional
graphic
touch
and
there
a
little
more
fully
developed
detail
made
the
fully
matured
statement
an
entirely
different
thing
to
the
modest
seed
from
which
it
sprang
we
have
already
encountered
many
instances
of
how
the
most
ordinary
creatures
are
described
in
a
way
that
leads
one
to
suppose
that
the
two
great
virtues
in
a
naturalist
observation
and
experiment
were
almost
entirely
wanting
at
any
period
for
the
last
two
thousand
years
or
more
how
else
could
such
a
belief
as
that
the
badger
has
his
two
legs
on
one
side
shorter
than
the
other
two
have
ever
gained
credence
or
that
the
ram
when
he
slepeth
from
spring
time
till
harvest
he
lyeth
on
the
one
side
and
from
harvest
till
spring
time
againe
on
the
other
side
or
to
travel
a
little
further
afield
that
the
whiskers
of
a
tiger
are
mortal
poison
causing
men
to
die
mad
if
given
to
them
in
meat
or
that
the
camel
is
so
ashamed
of
its
ugliness
that
before
drinking
in
a
stream
it
always
fouls
the
water
so
that
it
may
not
see
the
reflection
of
itself
or
fifty
other
statements
equally
at
variance
with
the
facts
the
respect
for
those
who
by
the
vigour
and
uncompromising
directness
of
their
assertions
became
regarded
as
great
authorities
was
so
tremendous
and
all
embracing
that
no
one
seemed
to
dare
to
challenge
statements
made
by
them
while
the
ease
and
comfort
to
subsequent
writers
of
having
all
responsibility
taken
off
their
own
shoulders
by
merely
copying
instead
of
testing
had
a
fatal
fascination
the
result
being
that
many
assertions
have
had
a
vigorous
vitality
for
centuries
that
could
have
been
readily
disproved
in
a
week
or
even
an
hour

honest
personal
investigation

or

as
much
an
article
of

as

as
far
as
we
are
aware
the
first
reference
to
it
is
found
in
the
pages
of
herodotus
and
the
story
as
he
tells
it
in
the
seventy
third
chapter
of
the
second
book
of
his
history
was
the
basis
upon
which
for
centuries
a
vast
superstructure
of
fabledom
was
reared
even
tacitus
one
of
the
most
cautious
and
reliable
of
authors
seems
to
have
felt
no
difficulty
in
believing
in
the
existence
of
the
ph
nix
erroneous
as
his
account
is
we
feel
at
once
on
reading
it
that
we
have
the
opinions
of
one
honestly
seeking
the
truth
a
very
different
sort
of
man
to
such
a
credulous
old
fellow
for
example
as
maundevile
tacitus
writes
that
in
the
course
of
the
year
the
miraculous
bird
known
to
the
world
by
the
name
of
the
ph
nix
after
disappearing
for
a
series
of
ages
revisited
egypt
a
phenomenon
so
very
extraordinary
could
not
fail
to
produce
abundance
of
speculation
the
facts
about
which
there
seems
to
be
a
concurrence
of
opinions
with
other
circumstances
in
their
nature
doubtful
yet
worthy
of
notice
will
not
be
unwelcome
to
the
reader
that
the
ph
nix
is
sacred
to
the
sun
and
differs
from
the
rest
of
the
feathered
species
in
the
form
of
its
head
and
the
tincture
of
its
plumage
are
points
settled
by
the
naturalist
of
its
longevity
the
accounts
are
various
the
common
persuasion
is
that
it
lives
five
hundred
years
though
by
some
writers
the
date
is
extended
to
fourteen
hundred
and
sixty
one
it
is
the
custom
of
the
ph
nix
when
its
course
of
years
is
finished
and
the
approach
of
death
is
felt
to
build
a
nest
in
its
native
clime
arabia
and
there
deposit
the
principles
of
life
from
which
a
new
progeny
arises
the
first
care
of
the
young
bird
as
soon
as
fledged
and
able
to
trust
to
its
wings
is
to
perform
the
obsequies
of
its
father
but
this
duty
is
not
undertaken
rashly
he
collects
a
great
quantity
of
myrrh
and
to
try
his
strength
makes
frequent
excursions
with
a
load
on
his
back
when
he
has
made
his
experiment
through
a
great
tract
of
air
and
gains
sufficient
confidence
in
his
own
vigour
he
takes
up
the
body
of
his
father
and
flies
with
it
to
the
altar
of
the
sun
where
he
leaves
it
to
be
consumed
in
flames
of
fragrance
such
is
the
account
of
this
wonderful
bird
it
has
no
doubt
a
mixture
of
fable
but
that
the
ph
nix
from
time
to
time
appears
in
egypt
seems
to
be
a
fact
satisfactorily
ascertained
pliny
feels
no
difficulty
in
describing
the
ph
nix
declaring
that
it
is
about
the
size
of
an
eagle
the
neck
being
of
a
golden
sheen
the
body
purple
and
the
tail
of
an
azure
blue
though
he
admits
feeling
a
doubt
as
to
whether
it
can
be
true
that
only
one
is
in
existence
at
one
time
according
to
maundevile
he
hathe
a
crest
of
fedres
upon
his
hed
more
gret
than
the
poocok
hathe
and
his
nekke
is
yalowe
aftre
colour
of
an
orielle
that
is
a
ston
well
schynynge
and
his
bek
is
coloured
blew
and
his
wenges
ben
of
purpre
colour
and
the
taylle
is
yelow
and
red
and
he
is
a
fulle
fair
brid
to
loken
upon
for
he
schynethe
full
nobely
one
wonders
at
first
how
this
old
writer
is
able
to
give
such
very
precise
details
but
as
he
tells
us
that
this
bryd
men
sene
often
tyme
fleen
in
the
countrees
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
full
description
of
it
from
some
of
these
countrymen
to
whom
it
was
a
familiar
sight
maundevile
does
not
fail
in
his
book
of
voiage
and
travaile
to
recite
the
whole
wonderful
story
he
tells
us
that
in
egypt
is
the
cytee
of
elyople
that
is
to
seyne
the
cytee
of
the
sonne
in
that
cytee
there
is
a
temple
made
round
after
the
schappe
of
the
temple
of
jerusalem
the
prestes
of
that
temple
have
alle
here
wrytynges
under
the
date
of
the
foul
that
is
clept
fenix
and
there
is
non
but
one
in
alle
the
worlde
and
he
comethe
to
brenne
him
selfe
upon
the
awtre
of
the
temple
at
the
end
of
five
hundred
yeer
for
so
longe
he
lyvethe
and
at
the
five
hundred
yeres
ende
the
prestes
arrayen
here
awtere
honestly
and
putten
there
upon
spices
and
vif
sulphur
and
other
thinges
that
wolm
brenne
lightly
and
then
the
bryd
fenix
comethe
and
brenneth
him
self
to
ashes
and
the
first
day
aftre
men
fynden
in
the
ashes
a
worm
and
the
seconde
day
next
aftre
men
finden
a
brid
quyk
and
perfyt
and
the
thridde
day
next
aftre
he
fleethe
his
wey
and
so
there
is
no
more
briddes
of
that
kynde
in
alle
the
world
but
it
alone
this
belief
in
the
ph
nix
is
found
not
only
through
heathen
and
medi
val
literature
but
in
the
rabbinical
writings
and
those
of
the
early
fathers
of
the
christian
church
by
these
latter
it
was
accepted
as
a
symbol
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
it
may
not
unfrequently
be
found
figured
in
the
mosaics
that
adorn
the
basilicas
of
the
primitive
church
the
rabbins
tell
us
that
all
the
birds
save
the
ph
nix
shared
in
the
sin
of
eve
and
eat
of
the
forbidden
fruit
hence
the
ph
nix
as
a
reward
obtained
this
modified
form
of
immutability
philippe
de
thaun
in

bestiary
writes
of

as

of
the

st
ambrose
says
too
that
the
bird
of
arabia
teaches
us
by
its
example
to
believe
in
the
resurrection
other
passages
of
like
tenour
could
be
quoted
from
tertullian
and
others
of
the
writers
of
the
early
christian
church
and
all
alike
show
the
most
unquestionable
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
bird
it
was
suggested
by
cuvier
that
at
remote
intervals
a
golden
pheasant
from
china
might
have
strayed
as
far
west
as
arabia
or
egypt
and
given
rise
to
the
legend
but
gorgeous
as
the
bird
is
and
fully
capable
of
making
a
considerable
sensation
on
its
appearance
in
a
land
where
it
was
previously
unknown
one
feels
that
such
an
appearance
goes
but
a
very
little
way
indeed
towards
clearing
up
the
mass
of
myth
that
still
remains
to
be
some
way
accounted
for
browne
in
his
excellent
dissection
of
the
vulgar
errors
of
his
day
approaches
the
ph
nix
story
tenderly
but
feels
bound
to
declare
against
it
though
he
rather
takes
refuge
in
the
scottish
verdict
of
not
proven
than
slaughters
it
in
cold
blood
that
there
is
but
one
ph
nix
in
the
world
saith
he
which
after
many
hundred
yeares
burneth
itself
and
from
the
ashes
thereof
ariseth
up
another
is
a
conceit
not
new
or
altogether
popular
but
of
great
antiquity
not
only
delivered
by
humane
authors
but
frequently
expressed
by
holy
writers
by
cyril
epiphanius
and
others
all
which
notwithstanding
we
cannot
presume
the
existence
of
this
animall
nor
dare
we
affirm
there
is
any
ph
nix
in
nature
for
first
there
wants
herein
the
definite
test
of
things
uncertain
that
is
the
sense
of
man
for
though
many
writers
have
much
enlarged
hereon
there
is
not
any
ocular
describer
or
such
as
presumeth
to
confirm
it
upon
aspection
primitive
authors
from
whom
the
stream
of
relations
is
derivative
deliver
themselves
dubiously
and
either
by
a
doubtful
parenthesis
or
a
timorous
conclusion
overthrow
the
whole
relation
as
for
its
unity
or
conceit
that
there
should
be
but

no

conclude

not

in

some

held
that
a

singular
and
noble

must
be
of

virtue
for

ills
of

quoth

they
were
not

unto

or

who
derived

from

as
some
have
done
it
is
a
folly
to
finde
out
remedies
that
are
not

under

years
or
propose
the
prolonging
of

by
that
which
the

generation
may
never

more
veniable
is
a
dependence
upon
the
philosopher
s
stone
potable
gold
or
any
of
those
arcanas
whereby
paracelsus
that
died
himself
at
fourty
seven
gloried
that
he
could
make
men
immortall
which
although
exceedingly
difficult
yet
they
are
not
impossible
nor
doe
they
rightly
understood
impose
any
violence
on
nature
and
therefore
if
strictly
taken
for
the
ph

very
strange
is
that
which
is
delivered
by

that
the

thereof

that

the

an
indulgence
in

must
have
been
infinitesimal
the
ph
nix
may
still
be
considered
to
have
a
literary
existence
and
remains
part
of
the
stock
in
trade
of
the
orator
and
poet
as
an
emblem
of
something
especially
choice
and
rare
fletcher
writes
of
that
lone
bird
in
fruitful
arabie
when
now
her
strength
and
waning
life
decays
upon
some
airy
rock
or
mountain
high
in

herself
and
all
her
crooked

consumes

from
her
ashes
and
those
rich
perfumes
a
newborn
ph

flies
and
widow
d
place
resumes
ariosto
in
his
orlando
furioso
refers
to
the
bird
in
the
voyage
of
astolfo
in
the
following
lines
arabia

the

her

the
virgin
ph

there
in
search
of
rest
selects
from
all
the
world
her
balmy
nest
in
the
two
foregoing
extracts
the
ph
nix
has
been
represented
as
maiden
and
as
widow
and
in
the
first
line
of
ariosto
the
pronoun
is
masculine
and
in
the
fourth
line
feminine
ovid
and
many
other
writers
in
describing
him
her
or
it
select
the
masculine
as
the
most
appropriate
thus
ovid
in
the
translation
of
dryden
sings
all
these
receive
their
birth
from
other
things
but
from
himself
the
ph

only
springs

by
the
parent
flame
in
which
he
burn
d
another
and
the
same
it
is
needless
to
give
the
rest
of
the
reference
as
the
ancient
poet
naturally
follows
in
the
lines
of
the
recognized
tradition
the
funeral
pyre
the
infant
ph
nix
rising
from
the
ashes
the
dutiful
removal
of
the
paternal
remains
to
heliopolis
all
taking
their
proper
and
accustomed
place
in
the
narrative
shakespeare
frequently
refers
to
the
mythical
bird
in
his
writings
and
seems
to
have
thoroughly
mastered
all
that
could
be
said
on
the
subject
some
half
dozen
passages
naturally
rise
to
one
s
mind
as
illustrations
of
this
thus
rosalind
says
in
as
you
like
it
she
calls
me
proud
and
that
she
could
not
love
me
were
man
as
rare
as
ph
nix
and
the
idea
of
its
unique
character
is
again
brought
out
in
cymbeline
in
the
passage
if
she
be
furnished
with
a
mind
so
rare
she
is
alone
the
arabian
bird
the
destruction
of
the
bird
on
its
own
funeral
pyre
and
the
resurrection
of
its
successor
therefrom
are
several
times
referred
to
thus
in
henry
vi
we
read
but
from
their
ashes
shall
be
reared
a
ph
nix
that
shall
make
all
france
afeared
and
in
henry
vi
my
ashes
as
the
ph
nix
may
bring
forth
a
bird
that
will
revenge
upon
you
all
some
little
doubt
of
its
existence
at
all
is
suggested
by
the
words
of
sebastian
in
the
tempest
now
i
will
believe
that
there
are
unicorns
that
in
arabia
there
is
one
tree
the
ph
nix
throne
one
ph
nix
at
this
time
reigning
there
notwithstanding
the
doubts
as
to
the
reality
of
this
creature
that
were
freely
expressed
in
the
seventeenth
century
two
feathers
that
were
said
to
be
from
the
tail
of
a
ph
nix
were
amongst
the
treasures
of
tradescant
s
museum
it
was
held
a
firm
article
of
belief
during
the
middle
ages
that
the
bird
of
paradise
fed
upon
nothing
more
gross
than
the
dew
of
heaven
and
the
odours
of
flowers
and
that
it
had
no
feet
nor
ever
rested
on
earth
at
all
thou
art
still
that
bird
of
paradise
which
hath
no
feet
and
ever
nobly
flies
it
is
a
sadly
prosaic
explanation
of
this
to
recall
that
its
footless
condition
simply
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
natives
of
molucca
in
sending
the
skins
to
europe
removed
the
legs
and
feet
as
needless
additions
seeing
that
the
beauty
of
the
plumage
was
the
reason
for
their
export
tavernier
relates
that
the
birds
of
paradise
come
in
flocks
during
the
nutmeg
season
to
the
south
of
india
the
strength
of
the
nutmeg
odour
intoxicates
them
and
while
they
lie
in
this
state
on
the
earth
the
ants
eat
off
their
legs
saving
the
last
terrible
detail
and
shocking
instance
of
what
may
befall
those
who
stray
from
the
paths
of
temperance
moore
evidently
adopts
this
account
in
lalla
rookh
in
the
lines
those
golden
birds
that
in
the
spicetime
drop
about
the
gardens
drunk
with
that
sweet
fruit
whose
scent
hath
lured
them
o
er
the
summer
flood
literary
allusions
to
the
bird
of
paradise
are
not
unfrequent
and
testify
to
the
general
acceptance
of
the
myth
that
has
grown
up
around
the
prosaic
facts
of
the
case
francis
thynne
in
his
emblemes
and
epigrames
a
d
takes
the
somewhat
exceptional
view
that
the
bird
is
to
be
pitied
there
is
a
birde
which
takes
the
name
of
paradise
the
fair
which
allwaies
lives
beatinge
the
winde
and
flienge
in
the
ayre
for
envious
nature
him
denies
the
helpe
of
resting
feete
wherby
hee
forced
is
in
th
ayre
incessantlie
to
fleete
the
roc
or
rukh
though
associated
nowadays
in
our
minds
with
the
thousand
and
one
nights
and
regarded
as
simply
an
illustration
of
the
lengths
that
the
eastern
love
of
the
wonderful
can
be
carried
to
was
an
article
of
faith
with
our
ancestors
marco
polo
in
his
wonderfully
interesting
book
on
his
travels
in
eastern
lands
refers
to
this
remarkable
bird
but
it
will
be
noted
that
he
merely
gives
the
account
as
hearsay
and
protects
himself
more
than
once
from
any
admission
of
personal
belief
in
the
creature
he
states
respecting
it
as
follows
the
people
of
the
island
report
that
at
a
certain
season
of
the
year
an
extraordinary
kind
of
bird
which
they
call
a
rukh
makes
its
appearance
from
the
southern
region
in
form
it
is
said
to
resemble
the
eagle
but
it
is
incomparably
greater
in
size
being
so
large
and
strong
as
to
seize
an
elephant
with
its
talons
and
to
lift
it
into
the
air
from
whence
it
lets
it
fall
to
the
ground
in
order
that
when
dead
it
may
prey
upon
the
carcase
persons
who
have
seen
this
bird
assert
that
when
the
wings
are
spread
they
measure
sixteen
paces
in
extent
from
point
to
point
and
that
the
feathers
are
eight
paces
in
length
and
thick
in
proportion
the
grand
khan
having
heard
this
extraordinary
relation
sent
messengers
to
the
island
on
the
pretext
of
demanding
the
release
of
one
of
his
servants
who
had
been
detained
there
but
in
reality
to
examine
into
the
circumstances
of
the
country
and
the
truth
of
the
wonderful
things
told
of
it
when
they
returned
to
the
presence
of
his
majesty
they
brought
with
them
as
i
have
heard
a
feather
of
the
rukh
positively
affirmed
to
have
measured
ninety
spans
this
surprising
exhibition
afforded
his
majesty
extreme
pleasure
and
upon
those
to
whom
it
was
presented
he
bestowed
valuable
gifts
the
existence
of
such
a
bird
seems
to
have
been
universally
credited
in
the
east
while
the
tale
passes
all
belief
as
it
stands
or
rather
as
it
lies
it
may
possibly
be
that
it
is
grossly
exaggerated
rather
than
entirely
fabulous
as
it
may
have
originated
from
the
occasional
sight
of
some
bird
of
vast
though
not
miraculous
dimensions
such
as
the
albatross
birds
of
fierce
aspect
measuring
many
feet
from
tip
to
tip
of
their
wings
though
with
strength
and
power
of
grip
considerably
short
of
transporting
elephants
from
their
umbrageous
retreats
to
mid
air
the
sixteen
paces
that
are
given
by
the
informants
of
marco
polo
as
the
measurement
of
the
wings
would
be
about
forty
feet
while
the
wing
measurement
of
the
albatross
would
not
exceed
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
thus
leaving
a
handsome
balance
to
be
put
to
the
credit
of
the
love
of
the
marvellous
jordanus
brought
back
from
india
the
story
of
certain
birds
which
are
called
roc
that
are
so
big
that
they
easily
carry
an
elephant
into
the
air
he
did
not
himself
see
one
of
these
the
nearest
he
is
able
to
approach
to
this
being
i
have
seen
a
certain
person
who
said
that
he
had
seen
one
of
these
birds
the
roc
was
said
to
lay
an
egg
equal
in
bulk
to
one
hundred
and
forty
eight
hen
s
eggs
the
precision
of
this
estimate
should
disarm
criticism
one
feels
in
face
of
it
that
to
have
said
one
hundred
and
fifty
would
have
been
a
fatal
yielding
to
the
charm
of
round
numbers
and
a
palpable
exaggeration
mr
lane
refers
to
an
arab
one
ibou
el
wardee
for
authority
for
the
statement
that
rocs
are
found
in
an
island
in
the
chinese
sea
that
have
each
wing
ten
thousand
fathoms
long
these
birds
find
no
difficulty
in
carrying
an
eagle
in
their
beak
plus
two
others
in
their
talons
wardee
also
knew
of
a
roc
s
egg
or
said
he
did
which
is
perhaps
not
quite
the
same
thing
on
one
of
these
islands
that
looked
like
an
enormous
white
dome
over
a
hundred
cubits
high
and
as
firm
as
a
mountain
many
of
the
beliefs
of
our
forefathers
had
a
refreshing
quaintness
about
them
and
one
of
the
quaintest
perhaps
of
these
was
the
notion
that
a
particular
kind
of
goose
sprang
from
the
barnacles
that
cluster
in
salt
water
on

wood

of

parts
which
may
very
well
accord
with
truth
but
what
our
eyes
haue
seene
and
hands
haue
touched
we
shall
declare
there
is
a
small
island
in
lancashire
called
the
pile
of
foulders
wherein
we
find
the
broken
pieces
of
old
and
bruised
ships
some
wherof
haue
been
cast
thither
by
shipwracke
and
also
the
trunks
and
bodies
with
the
branches
of
old
and
rotten
trees
cast
up
there
likewise
whereon
is
found
a
certaine
spawne
or
froth
that
in
time
breedeth
unto
certain
shels
in
shape
like
those
of
the
muskle
but
sharper
pointed
wherein
is
contained
a
thing
in
forme
like
a
lace
of
silke
finely
wouen
together
as
it
were
one
end
thereof
is
fastened
into
a
rude
masse
or
lumpe
which
in
time
commeth
to
the
shape
and
form
of
a
birde
when
it
is
perfectly
formed
the
shel
gapeth
open
and
the
first
thing
that
appeareth
is
the
foresaid
lace
or
string
next
come
the
legs
of
the
bird
hanging
out
and
as
it
groweth
greater
it
openeth
the
shel
by
degrees
til
at
length
it
is
all
come
forth
and
hangeth
onely
by
the
bill
in
short
space
after
it
commeth
to
ful
maturitie
and
falleth
into
the
sea
when
it
gathereth
feathers
and
groweth
to
a
fowle
bigger
than
a
mallard
and
lesser
than
a
goose
hauing
blacke
legs
and
bill
and
beake
and
feathers
blacke
and
white
spotted
in
such
manner
as
is
our
magpie
which
the

of

by
no
other
name
than
a

goose
which
place
therof
and
all
those
parts
adioining
doe
so
much
abound
therewith
that
one
of
the

is
bought
for
threepence
for
the
truth
wherof
if
any
doubt
may
it
please
them
to
repair
unto
me
and
i
shall
satisfie
them
by
the
testimony
of
good
witnesses
on
reading
the
foregoing
one
can
only
wonder
what
the
old
fellow
really
did
see
on
this
wild
sea
shore
amidst
the
wreckage
that
he
wrote
in
the
most
perfect
good
faith
and
in
the
strongest
belief
in
this
maruell
is
perfectly
evident
that
he
has
no
desire
to
practise
on
our
credulity
is
patent
but
it
is
equally
patent
that
his
own
credulity
got
the
better
of
his
judgment
he
goes
on
to
tell
us
that
on
another
occasion
near
dover
he
found
on
the
sea
shore
an
old
tree
trunk
covered
with
thousands
of
long
crimson
bladders
in
shape
like
unto
puddings
newly
filled
and
at
the
nether
end
therof
did
grow
a
shelfish
fashioned
somewhat
like
a
small
muskle
many
of
these
shells
he
brought
back
with
him
to
london
and
on
opening
them
he
tells
us
that
he
found
liuing
things
that
were
very
naked
shaped
like
a
bird

that

had
caused
some
little
stir
outside

we
may
perhaps
not
too
uncharitably
assume
that
the
foreigner
did
not
feel
altogether
displeased

so
great

british
wonder

sylvius
afterwards
better
known
to
the

as
pope
pius
ii
visited
scotland
in

and
while
there
made
diligent
inquiry
concerning
this
wonderful
tree
but
found
that
no
one
could
point
it
out
to
him
as
the
general
impression
that
one
gathers
on
reading
his
account
of
his
travels
is
that
he
appeared
in
scotland
rather
as
a
seeker
after
knowledge
than
as
the
recipient
of
a
wonderful
story
till
then
unknown
to
him
we
must
conclude
that
the
myth
had
spread
considerably
beyond
the
land
of
its
origin
in
fact
as
we
often
find
even
unto
the
present
day
in
divers
matters
the
intelligent
stranger
is
often
able
to
enlighten
the
natives
on
matters
in
which
we
might
reasonably
have
expected
to
find
them
well
informed
who
for
instance
would
ever
dream
of
asking
the
nearest
resident
to
a
cathedral
anything
of
its
history
or
seeking
from
the
shepherd
of
salisbury
plain
any
light
on
the
mysterious
origin
of
stonehenge
william
turner
one
of
the
earliest
writers
on
ornithology
described
the
barnacle
goose
as
being
produced
from
something
like
a
fungus
growing
from
old
wood
lying
in
the
sea
and
quotes
giraldus
cambrensis
as
his
authority
having
uncomfortable
misgivings
i
asked
he
writes
a
certain
clergyman
named
octavianus
by
birth
an
irishman
whom
i
knew
to
be
worthy
of
credit
if
he
thought
the
account
of
giraldus
was
to
be
believed
he
swearing
by
the
gospel
declared
that
which
giraldus
had
written
about
the
bird
was
most
true
that
he
had
himself
seen
and
handled
the
young
unformed
birds
and
that
if
i
would
remain
in
london
a
month
or
two
he
would
bring
me
some
of
the
brood
whether
turner
was
satisfied
by
the
very
unsatisfying
proof
of
the
production
of
some
dubious
ducks
in
london
or
by
the
solemn
declaration
and
oaths
taken
on
the
gospels
by
his
reverent
informant
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
as
he
inserts
the
wonder
in
his
book
he
was
evidently
relieved
from
his
previous
doubt
of
the
veracity
of
the
story
in
a
land

have
found

great
difficulty
in

anyone
who
can
credit
the
one
should
feel
no
hesitation
in
accepting
the
other
saxo
grammaticus
lobel
valcetro
and
many
other
writers
refer
to
the
barnacle
tree
some
with
full
belief
in
it
others
more
dubiously
but
it
is
of
course
needless
to
quote
a
multiplicity
of
authors
should
any
of
our
readers
themselves
feel
any
doubt
in
the
matter
they
may
very
advantageously
pay
a
visit
to
a
good
museum
where
probably
even
if
they
fail
to
find
a
goose
tree
they
may
see
much
else
that
will
be
almost
equally
a
wonder
and
a
delight
to
them
the
ancients
thoroughly
believed
that
the
eagle
proved
her
young
by
forcing
them
to
gaze
upon
the
sun
discarding
any
that
failed
to
face
the
test
and
the
belief
survived
well
into
the
middle
ages
before
that
her
little
ones
bee
feathered
she
will
beat
and
strike
them
with
her
wings
and
thereby
force
them
to
looke
full
against
the
sunne
beames
now
if
shee
see
any
one
of
them
to
winke
or
their
eies
to
water
at
the
raies
of
the
sunne
shee
turnes
it
with
the
head
foremost
out
of
the
nest
as
a
bastard
and
none
of
hers
but
bringeth
up
and
cherisheth
that
whose
eie
will
abide
the
light
of
the
sunne
as
she
looketh
directly
upon
him
it
will
be
remembered
that
shakespeare
in
king
henry
vi
refers
to
this
old
belief
when
the
duke
of
gloucester
addresses
the
young
prince
in
the
words
nay
if
thou
be
that
princely
eagle
s
bird

thy
descent
by
gazing
gainst
the
sun

ariosto
again
we
have
the
same
reference
where
he
styles
the
eagle
the
bird
that
dares
with
steadfast
eyes
apollo

light
and
dryden
exclaims
in
his
britannia
rediviva
truth
which
is
light
itself
doth
darkness
shun
and
the
true
eaglet
safely
dares
the
sun
the
keenness
of
vision
of
the
eaglet
has
been
noted
in
all
ages
and
its
powers
sometimes
made
even
more
astonishing
than
facts
can
justify
it
has
been
asserted
that
when
the
eagle
has
soared
into
the
air
to
a
height
that
has
rendered
it
perfectly
invisible
to
human
eye
it
can
discern
the
motions
of
the
smaller
animals
upon
the
earth
and
swoop
down
upon
them
from
the
sky
and
homer
in
the
iliad
it
will
be
recalled
describes
menelaus
as
the
field
exploring
with
an
eye
keen
as
the
eagle
s
keenest
eyed
of
all
that
wing
the
air
whom
though
he
soar
aloft

lev
ret
scapes
not
hid
in
thickest
shades
but
down
he
swoops
and
at
a
stroke
she
dies
the
eastern
writers
ever
given
to
hyperbole
have
assigned
to
the
eagle
powers
of
vision
of
a
far
more
astonishing
character
than
this
one
of
them
damir
quoted
by
burckhardt
declares
that
the
eagle
can
discern
its
prey
at
a
distance
of
four
hundred
parasangs
more
than
a
thousand
miles
and
poets
of
all
periods
have
drawn
striking
images
from
the
wonderful
power
of
vision
of
the
king
of
birds
medi
val
naturalists
have
asserted
that
this
magnificent
eyesight
was
strengthened
even
beyond
its
natural
powers
by
a
diet
on
the
eagle
s
part
of
wild
lettuce
in
the
same
way
that
the
linnet
cleared
its
sight
by
means
of
the
eyebright
the
swallow
through
use
of
the
celandine
and
divers
other
birds
through
use
of
some
special
herb
that
they
had
proved
to
be
of
value
to
them
our
readers
will
doubtless
remember
the
fine
passage
in
the
areopagitica
of
milton
methinks
i
see
in
my
mind
a
noble
and
puissant
nation
rousing
herself
like
a
strong
man
after
sleep
and
shaking
her
invincible
locks
methinks
i
see
her
as
an
eagle
renewing
her
mighty
youth
and
kindling
her
undazzled
eyes
at
the
full
midday
beam
it
was
one
of
the
beliefs
of
our
forefathers
that
the
eagle
had
this
power
of
rejuvenescence
the
description
of
the
process
has
a
very
prosaic
sound
about
it
but
the
result
is
highly
successful
when
the
eagle
hathe
darknesse
and
dimnesse
in
eien
and
hevinesse
in
wings
against
this
disadvantage
she
is
taught
by
kinde
to
seeke
a
well
of
springing
water
and
then
she
flyeth
up
into
the
aire
as
farre
as
she
may
till
she
bee
full
hot
by
heat
of
the
aire
and
by
travaile
of
flight
and
so
then
by
heat
the
pores
be
opened
and
the
feathers
chafed
and
she
falleth
sideinglye
into
the
well
and
there
the
feathers
be
chaunged
and
the
dimnesse
of
her
eien
is
wiped
away
and
purged
and
she
taketh
againe
her
might
and
strength
it
was
a
strange
belief
of
the
writers
of
antiquity
on
these
natural
history
topics
that
the
feathers
of
the
eagle
when
placed
amongst
those
of
other
birds
in
a
short
space
of
time
entirely
consumed
them
while
the
king
of
beasts
has
been
credited
with
generosity
and
other
royal
virtues
the
eagle
king
of
birds
seems
not
to
have
developed
either
in
nature
or
in
fable
any
such
regal
qualities
the
most
favourable
estimate
we
have
encountered
is
that
of
the
speculum
mundi
and
even
that
leaves
much
to
be
desired
the
eagle
writes
our
authority
is
commended
for
her
faithfulnesse
towards
other
birds
in
some
kinde
though
sometimes
she
show
herselfe
cruell
they
all
stand
in
awe
of
her
and
when
she
hath
gotten
meat
she
useth
to
communicate
it
unto
such
fowls
as
do
accompany
with
her
onely
this
some
affirme
that
when
she
hath
no
more
to
make
distribution
of
then
she
will
attack
some
of
her
guests
and
for
lack
of
food
dismember
them
the
eagle
is
often
depicted
as
bearing
the
thunderbolts
of
jove
from
an
ancient
belief
that
of
all
flying
fowles
the
gle
only
is
not
smitten
nor
killed
with

secure
from
thunder

the
pelican
has
been
pressed
into
the
service
of
religious
symbolism
from
a
belief
that
it
nourished
its
young
with
its
own
blood
and
hence
it
was
made
the
emblem
of
loving
sacrifice
the
pelicane
whose
sons
are

good
friends
thus
wide
i
ll
ope
my
arms
and
like
the
kind
life
rendering
pelican
refresh
them
with
my
blood
the
whole
myth
is
based
upon
a
very
slender
basis
indeed
as
it
is
conjectured
that
it
arose
from
the
habit
of
the
bird
pressing
its
breast
feathers
with
its
bill
the
bill
itself
having
a
crimson
spot
at
its
extremity
that
suggested
the
idea
of
blood
when
the
bird
is
represented
in
ecclesiastical
work
or
as
a
charge
in
heraldry
it
is
always
shown
in
this
position
and
is
known
technically
as
a
pelican
in
her
piety
many
of
the
early
writers
accept
the
legend
in
the
most
perfect
good
faith
and
no
more
doubted
that
the
young
pelicans
were
reared
on
the
blood
of
the
mother
bird
than
that
hens
would
eat
barley
or
sparrows
come
for
bread
crumbs
some
ecclesiastical
writers
whom
we
cannot
quite
exonerate
from
acting
on
the
principle
that
it
is
lawful
to
do
ill
if
good
flows
from
it
added
the
detail
that
when
the
young
of
the
pelican
were
destroyed
by
serpents
the
mother
pelican
shed
her
blood
upon
them
and
brought
them
to
life
again
and
hence
became
a
striking
symbol
of
the
restoration
to
life
of
those
dead
in
trespasses
and
sin
by
the
vivifying
blood
of
the
redeemer
of
mankind
it
was
for
many
centuries
a

at

strains

tongue
and
is
the

of
his

made
in

a

days
before

to

refers
frequently
to
the
belief
thus
in
the
merchant
of

says
then
if

he
makes
a
swan

in
music
after
king
john
is
poisoned
his
son
prince
henry
is
told
that
in
his
dying
frenzy
he
sang
whereupon
the
prince
replies
tis
strange
that
death
should
sing
i
am

to
this
pale

swan
who
chants
a
doleful
hymn
to
his
own
death
and
from
the
organ

of
frailty
sings
his
soul
and
body
to
their
lasting
rest
many
similar
passages
might
be
quoted
from
the
poets
it
will
suffice
to
give
but
one
example
place
me
on
sunium
s
marbled
steep
where
nothing
save

and
i
may
hear
our
mutual
murmurs

me
sing
and
die
though
the
ordinary
swan
of
our
english
lakes
and
rivers
would
appear
to
be
without
a
grain
of
music
in
its
composition
the
black
swan
of
australia
now
naturalized
in
our
midst
has
a
really
very
musical
note
and
one
too
which
it
very
readily
utters
not
by
any
means
reserving
it
as
a
p
an
of
approaching
dissolution
it
was
a
firm
article
of
belief
with
the
older
writers
such
as
pliny
aristotle
and
lian
that
the
swan
was
especially
exposed
to
attack
from
the
eagle
and
that
when
thus
assailed
it
fought
with
extreme
determination
and
never
failed
to
come
off
victor
in
the
fray
illustration
fig
to
the
ostrich
was
accredited
the
power
of
digesting
iron
how
such
an
idea
could
have
arisen
it
is
now
impossible
to
explain
in
allusion
to
this
myth
the
bird
when
introduced
in
blazonry
as
in
fig
from
a
medi
val
flagon
ordinarily
has
a
horse
shoe
in
its
mouth
the
artist
who
thus
represented
the
bird
was
evidently
by
no
means
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
plumage
of
the
ostrich
was
another
very
characteristic
feature
shakespeare
in
his
henry
vi
makes
jack
cade
declare
i
ll
make
thee
eat
iron
like
an
ostrich
and
swallow
my
sword
like
a
great
pin
while
munster
in
his
cosmography
gravely
gives
a
picture
of
an
ostrich
with
an
immense
key
in
his
mouth
and
at
his
feet
as
second
course
a
horse
shoe
cogan
the
author
of
the
very
popular
haven
of
health
finds
apt
simile
herein
the
fat
of
flesh
he
says
alone
without
leane
is
unwholesome
and
cloyeth
the
stomack
and
causeth
lothsomnes
yet
have
i
knowne
a
country
man
that
would
feed
onely
of
the
fat
of
bacon
or
pork
without
leane
but
that
is
not
to
bee
marvelled
at
considering
that
many
of
them
have
stomackes
like
the
bird
that
is
called
an
ostridge
which
can
digest
hard
iron
it
was
held
that
the
ostrich
never
hatches
her
eggs
by
sitting
upon
them
but
by
the
rays
of
warmth
and
light
from
her
eyes
southey
alludes
it
will
be
remembered
to
this
old
fancy
in
the
lines
with
such
a
look
as
fables
say
the
mother
ostrich
fixes
on
her
eggs
till
that
intense
affection
kindle
its
light
of
life
a
considerable
body
of
folk
lore
is
associated
with
the
cock
one
strange
notion
that
crops
up
in
the
books
of
the
medi
val
writers
is
that
the
lion
has
a
strong
antipathy
to
this
bird
and
that
the
crowing
of
chanticleer
will
effectually
put
to
the
rout
the
king
of
beasts
one
can
readily
imagine
that
the
lion
prowling
in
the
darkness
round
some
human
habitation
would
naturally
resent
the
shrill
clarion
of
the
cock
and
that
this
idea
might
with
the
delight
in
mysticism
and
symbolism
of
the
middle
ages
be
readily
transferred
to
the
roaring
lion
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
thwarted
by
the
vigilance
of
which
the
cock
is
the
emblem
even
so
early
however
as
the
pre
christian
days
of
pliny
we
find
this
belief
in
the
antagonism
between
the
two
creatures
in
full
operation
for
this
ancient
author
prescribes
the
broth
from
a
stewed
cock
as
an
excellent
outward
application
for
those
in
peril
from
wild
beasts
declaring
confidently
that
whosoever
shall
bathe
himself
in
this
shall
fear
no
harm
from
lion
or
panther
gerard
legh
in
his
accedence
of
armorie
affirms
that
the
cocke
is
the
royallest
birde
that
is
and
of
himself
a
king
for
nature
hath
crowned
hime
with
a
perpetuall
diademe
to
him
and
to
his
posteritie
for
ever
he
is
the
valiantest
in
battle
of
all
birdes
for
he
will
rather
die
than
yeelde
to
his
aduersarie
and
one
old
writer
goes
so
far
as
to
declare
that
the
lion
whom
we
have
always
been
taught
to
regard
as
generosity
itself
feels
his
royal
title
somewhat
impaired
by
the
rivalry
of
the
barn
door
fowl
and
that
the
pretension
to
royalty
suggested
by
the
scarlet
crest
is
distasteful
to
the
king
of
beasts
who
can
brook
no
idea
of
a
rival
there
was
throughout
the
middle
ages
an
idea
that
one
was
able
to
incorporate
any
desirable
quality
by
looking
around
for
some
creature
of
which
it
was
a
characteristic
and
then
promptly
making
some
culinary
preparation
of
which
this
creature
s
flesh
should
be
a
leading
ingredient
if
says
one
of
these
sages
you
would
have
a
man
talkative
give
him
tongues
and
seek
out
for
him
water
frogs
wilde
geese
and
ducks
and
other
such
creatures
notorious
for
their
continual
noise
making
and
thus
the
sturdy
self
assertion
and
valour
of
the
cock
naturally
suggested
the
idea
that
the
weakly
and
retiring
would
find
in
him
valuable
nutriment
in
an
old
cookery
book
we
find
how
to
still
a
cocke
for
a
weak
body
that
is
in
consumption
through
long
sicknesse
the
cock
selected
must
be
a
red
one
and
not
too
old
having
cut
him
into
quarters
he
must
be
put
into
an
earthenware
pot
with
the
rootes
of
fennell
parcely
and
succory
corans
whole
mace
annise
seeds
and
liquorice
scraped
and
slyced
half
a
pint
of
rose
water
and
a
quart
of
white
wine
are
then
to
be
added
together
with
two
or
three
cleane
dates
a
few
prunes
and
raysons
and
then
all
must
stew
gently
for
the
space
of
twelve
hours
finally
streine
out
the
broth
into
some
cleane
vessell
and
give
thereof
unto
the
weak
person
morning
and
evening
warmed
and
spiced
as
pleaseth
the
patient
our
ancestors
even
when
in
rude
health
quaffed
a
beverage
known
as
cock
ale
in
order
that
they
might
preserve
their
vigour
this
drink
strong
ale
mixed
with
the
broth
of
a
boiled
cock
is
mentioned
in
the
old
plays
such
as
woman
turned
bully
written
in
the
year
in
digby
s
book
of
receipts
the
closet
open
published
in
and
divers
other
medical
and
culinary
works
of
the
middle
ages
in
these
same
good
old
times
the
liver
of
a
male
goat
the
tail
of
a
shrew
mouse
the
brain
and
comb
of
a
cock
the
worm
under
the
tongue
of
a
mad
dog
pounded
ants
cuckoo
broth
were
all
suggested
as
remedies
for
hydrophobia
though
like
the
fish
brine
of
pliny
or
the
pounded
crab
of
galen
they
must
have
been
but
sorry
reeds
to
rest
upon
in
the
dreadful
paroxysms
of
this
terrible
malady
the
ancient
romans
believed
in
the
existence
of
a
crystalline
stone
which
they
called
alectorius
as
large
as
a
bean
and
to
be
found
in
the
gizzard
of
a
cock
though
not
by
any
means
discoverable
in
every
fowl
cut
open
this
stone
was
held
to
have
the
wonderful
property
of
rendering
the
human
possessor
of
it
invisible
it
may
indeed
have
had
the
same
effect
on
the
original
owner
as
there
could
scarcely
be
an
authentic
instance
of
a
stone
of
such
peculiar
property
being
found
but
if
the
fowl
itself
could
not
be
seen
it
is
scarcely
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
stone
within
it
should
be
equally
invisible
the
belief
in
some
such
stone
was
one
of
the
numerous
articles
of
faith
of
the
middle
ages
but
instead
of
the
property
of
invisibility
being
attached
to
its
possessor
they
sometimes
substituted
for
it
the
much
more
prosaic
idea
that
its
owner
could
never
feel
thirsty
while
the
way
to
discover
the
bird
that
possessed
it
was
simplicity
itself
it
being
only
necessary
to
discover
which
fowl
at
feeding
time
never
drank
the
first
belief
is
much
the
more
tenable
and
is
in
fact
impossible
of
refutation
as
the
world
may
be
full
of
the
owners
of
alectorius
invisible
to
us
and
therefore
unknown
the
cock
was
at
one
time
supposed
to
possess
the
power
of
laying
eggs
from
which
were
reared
the
deadly
cockatrice
when
the
cock
is
past
seven
years
old
an
egg
grows
within
him
whereat
he
greatly
wonders
he
seeks
privately
a
warm
place
and
scratches
a
hole
for
a
nest
to
which
he
goes
ten
times
daily
a
toad
privily
watches
him
and
examines
the
nest
every
day
to
see
if
the
egg
be
yet
laid
when
the
toad
finds
the
egg
he
rejoices
much
and
at
length
hatches
it
bringing
forth
an
animal
with
the
head
neck
and
breast
of
a
cock
and
from
thence
downward
the
body
of
a
serpent
in
the
year
a
cock
at
basle
was
publicly
accused
of
having
laid
one
of
these
very
objectionable
eggs
and
after
a
short
trial
was
sentenced
to
death
and
burnt
together
with
the
egg
in
the
market
place
amid
a
great
concourse
of
the
towns
folk
who
were
right
joyfully
thankful
to
feel
that
a
great
peril
had
been
averted
by
the
prompt
action
of
their
rulers
for
a
cockatrice
was
indeed
no
laughing
matter
to
those
who
thought
it
one
of
the
possibilities
of
life
in
england
the
hens
have
entirely
usurped
the
egg
laying
department
and
we
are
therefore
spared
the
mortification
of
finding
that
our
hoped
for
chick
has
assumed
the
less
welcome
form
of
a
cockatrice
the
poison
of
a
cockatrice
was
without
cure
and
the
air
was
in
such
a
degree
affected
by
it
that
no
creature
could
live
near
it
it
killed
we
are
assured
not
only
by
its
touch
for
even
the
sight
of
the
cockatrice
like
that
of
the
basilisk
was
death
we
read
for
instance
in
romeo
and
juliet
of
the
death
darting
eye
of
cockatrice
and
again
in
king
richard
iii
a
cockatrice
hast
thou
hatched
into
the
world
whose
unavoided
eye
is
murtherous
while
in
twelfth
night
we
find
the
passage
this
will
so
fright
them
both
that
they
will
kill
one
another
by
the
look
like
cockatrices
the
good
people
of
basle
might
therefore
believing
all
this
very
heartily
congratulate
themselves
on
their
escape
from
a
fearful
peril
the
baleful
cockatrice
is
often
referred
to
in
literature
thus
in
the
book
entitled
some
yeares
trauels
into
africa
and
asia
the
great
written
by
sir
thomas
herbert
and
published
in
london
in
the
year
the
writer
says
that
mohamed
on
finishing
his
koran
was
so
transported
that
to
mecca
he
goes
to
have
it
credited
but
therein
his
predictions
fail
him
for
so
soon
as
the
arabs
perceived
his
design
being
formerly
acquainted
with
his
birth
and
breeding
they
banish
him
and
but
for
his
wives
relations
there
had
crushed
him
and
his
cockatrice
egg
which
was
but
then
hatching
legh
in
his
curiosities
of
heraldry
gives
the
usual
details
of
the
death
dealing
cockatrice
but
adds
though
he
be
venome
withoute
remedye
whilest
he
liueth
yet
when
he
is
dead
and
burnt
to
ashes
he
loseth
all
his
malice
and
the
ashes
of
him
are
good
for
alkumistes
in
turnyng
and
chaungyng
of
metall
practically
therefore
all
that
stands
or
shall
we
say
lies
between
ourselves
and
wealth
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
is
but
a
cockatrice
moribund
orthography
was
not
a
strong
point
in
these
old
writers
and
the
word
which
is
now
established
as
cockatrice
may
be
met
with
as
cocatrice
cokatrice
kokatrice
kocatrice
cockatryse
cocatryse
cocautrice
cockautrice
coccatryse
cocatris
kokatrix
chocatrix
and
many
other
forms
it
has
long
been
a
belief
in
many
parts
of
the
country
that
if
a
cock
crow
at
midnight
the
angel
of
death
is
passing
over
the
house
and
that
if
he
delays
to
strike
it
is
but
for
a
short
season
it
is
evident
however
that
a
score
or
more
of
different
households
may
hear
the
same
cock
crow
and
we
can
scarcely
conclude
that
it
is
to
be
fatal
to
all
since
such
wholesale
slaughter
would
quickly
depopulate
whole
hamlets
and
we
might
really
almost
as
well
have
the
dread
cockatrice
at
once
cock
crowing
in
medi
val
days
received
mystical
importance
from
a
belief
that
it
was
in
the
dawn
of
the
morning
that
our
saviour
was
born
it
was
regarded
too
as
a
warning
voice
telling
of
the
coming
of
the
day
of
judgment
and
from
its
association
with
st
peter
s
grievous
denial
of
his
master
a
warning
against
self
sufficiency
and
base
cowardice
it
was
thought
that
during
the
hours
of
darkness
evil
spirits
and
the
souls
of
the
departed
were
abroad
and
that
these
fled
at
daybreak
hence
shakespeare
makes
the
ghost
of
hamlet
s
father
vanish
at
this
season
it
faded
on
the
crowing
of
the
cock
to
the
belief
that
on
christmas
eve
the
night
was
entirely
free
from
any
such
spiritual
manifestation
he
refers
in
the
beautiful
lines

the
pellycane
the
swalowe
all
singing
in
quaint
blending
of
latin
and
english
the
praise
of
god
the
raven
the
hoarse
night
raven
trompe
of
doleful
drere
has
been
at
almost
all
periods
regarded
with
superstitious
awe
shakespeare
for
instance
writes
of
the
raven
that
croaks
the
fatal
entrance
of
duncan
and
again
in
othello
we
find
the
illustrative
passage
it
comes
o
er
my
memory
as
doth
the
raven
o
er
the
infected
house
boding
to
all
marlowe
in
like
spirit
in
his
rich
jew
of
malta
dwells
on
the
sad
presaging
raven
that
tolls
the
sick
man
s
passport
in
her
hollow
beak
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
silent
night
doth
shake
contagion
from
her
sable
wings
the
whole
field
of
literature
teems
with
references
of
the
same
ominous
character
it
will
suffice
to
add
but
one
more
illustration
where
gay
in
the
dirge
notices
the
evil
presage
in
the
lines
the
boding
raven
on
her
cottage
sat
and
with
hoarse
croakings
warned
us
of
our
fate
the
raven
is
sometimes
called
the
devil
s
bird
it
is
believed
that
it
was
originally
white
but
that
it
was
changed
to
black
for
its
disobedience
what
this
disobedience
was
appears
to
be
a
very
moot
point
the
old
greeks
believed
that
apollo
once
sent
it
to
a
fountain
to
fetch
water
and
the
bird
on
arrival
found
a
fig
tree
with
very
nearly
ripe
fruit
and
determined
to
wait
until
they
were
quite
so
as
this
was
a
matter
of
some
few
days
it
became
necessary
to
invent
some
plausible
explanation
of
the
delay
so
he
took
a
water
snake
out
of
the
fountain
and
brought
it
in
the
pitcher
to
the
god
and
explained
that
this
creature
had
drunk
the
reservoir
dry
apollo
declining
to
accept
this
explanation
turned
the
disobedient
raven
black
condemned
it
to
be
always
plagued
with
thirst
and
changed
its
once
melodious
voice
into
the
monstrous
croak
that
it
has
ever
since
been
uttering
as
token
of
its
punishment
medi
val
writers
do
not
accept
this
story
at
all
but
declare
that
the
real
reason
that
the
raven
exchanged
its
snow
white
plumage
for
the
sable
garb
was
the
consequence
of
its
disobedience
when
instead
of
returning
to
the
ark
to
noah
it
stayed
to
feed
on
the
bodies
of
the
drowned
it
will
be
seen
that
in
each
case
disobedience
was
the
offence
and
appetite
the
occasion
thereof
it
is
rather
startling
after
this
to
read
in
the
quaint
pages
of
legh
that
the
rauen
delighteth
so
much
in
her
owne
bewty
that
when
her
birds
are
hatched
she
will
giue
them
no
meate
vntill
she
see
whether
they
will
bee
of
her
owne
colour
or
no
guillim
another
writer
like
legh
on
matters
heraldic
entirely
supports
this
statement
declaring
that
it
hath
bene
an
ancient
received
opinion
and
the
same
also
grounded
vpon
the
warrant
of
the
holy
scriptures
that
such
is
the
property
of
the
raven
that
from
the
time
his
young
ones
are
hatched
or
disclosed
untill
he
seeth
what
colour
they
will
be
of
he
never
careth
of
them
nor
ministereth
any
food
unto
them
therefore
it
is
thought
that
they
are
in
the
meane
space
nourished
with
the
heavenly
dew
and
so
muche
also
doth
the
kingly
prophet
david
affirme
which
giveth
fodder
unto
the
catell
and
feedeth
the
young
ravens
that
call
upon
him
the
raven
is
of
colour
blacke
and
when
he
perceiveth
his
young
ones
to
be
pennefeathered
and
black
like
himself
then
doth
he
labour
by
all
means
to
foster
and
cherish
them
from
thence
forward
surprising
as
it
is
to
find
that
the
sable
plumage
that
we
regard
as
the
mark
of
disgrace
is
to
the
bird
himself
or
herself
for
legh
refers
to
the
maternal
pride
and
guillim
to
the
paternal
a
beauty
that
no
bastard
brood
can
attain
to
it
is
still
more
surprising
to
find
that
this
devil
s
bird
and
messenger
of
woe
is
really
not
by
any
means
so
black
as
he
is
painted
and
is
indeed
possessed
of
deep
religious
feeling
maundevile
in
his
pilgrimage
to
mount
sinai
saw
and
heard
of
many
wonderful
things
and
certainly
what
he
heard
in
that
sacred
spot
of
the
ravens
must
have
greatly
astonished
him
he
tells
us
that
at
the
shrine
of
st
catherine
he
found
many
lamps
burning
and
the
monks
rejoicing
in
an
abundance
of
oyle
of
olyves
both
for
to
brenne
in
here
lampes
and
to
ete
also
and
that
plentee

how

to
so
excellent
a
cause
one
can
indeed
only
feel
that
it
is
more
probable
that
the

was
made
to

moral
than
the
moral

like
most
other
things
in

the

would
appear
that
there
was
scarely
anything
better
for

than

but
to
make
it
effectually
one
or
two
points
that
appear
in
themselves
of
little
importance
had
to
be
scrupulously
observed
for
those
who
care
to
make
trial
of
it
we

the
talisman
known
as
the
raven
stone
was
held
to
confer
on
its
holder
invisibility
and
we
may
remark
in
passing
on
the
curious
attraction
that
in
the
middle
ages
this
gift
of
invisibility
possessed
whether
used
as
a
means
of
shielding
one
s
self
from
dangers
as
a
means
of
inflicting
without
detection
injuries
on
others
or
the
dishonourable
desire
of
secretly
spying
upon
their
proceedings
it
appears
to
point
to
a
somewhat
unwholesome
state
of
things
too
suggestive
of
cowardice
and
treachery
to
be
at
all
an
object
to
be
sought
after
there
were
many
such
kinds
of
talisman
all
doubtless
of
equal
efficacy
and
all
of
them
naturally
presenting
considerable
difficulties
in
acquisition
the
raven
stone
was
no
exception
it
was
necessary
first
to
discover
a
nest
then
to
climb
the
tree
and
to
take
from
the
brood
one
of
the
nestlings
and
kill
it
the
victim
must
be
a
male
bird
and
not
more
than
six
weeks
old
so
far
with
reasonable
powers
of
observation
a
fair
amount
of
agility
and
sufficient
sense
to
visit
the
nest
at
a
time
when
one
might
reasonably
expect
to
find
young
birds
therein
there
would
appear
to
be
no
great
difficulty
but
unless
the
parent
birds
were
at
least
a
hundred
years
old
all
this
preliminary
trouble
was
of
no
avail
having
descended
the
tree
in
safety
the
slaughtered
nestling
had
to
be
placed
at
its
foot
and
watch
kept
for
the
return
of
the
parent
raven
on
its
return
it
will
be
observed
to
place
a
stone
in
the
throat
of
its
offspring
whereupon
nothing
remains
but
to
secure
the
treasure
and
proceed
to
exercise
its
mystic
power
how
many
persons
actually
put
the
matter
to
the
test
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
say
but
full
belief
in
its
efficacy
was
for
generations
an
article
of
faith
to
thousands
the
owl
like
the
raven
was
regarded
by
our
forefathers
with
great
awe
as
an
omen
of
misfortune
and
death
thus
in
shakespeare
we
find
several
allusions
to
this
superstitious
belief
out
on
ye
owls
nothing
but
songs
of
death
and
the
boding
scritch
owl
as
he
is
called
in
henry
vi
reappears
in
macbeth
in
the
passage
it
was
the
owl
that
shriek
d
that
fatal
bellman
which
giv
st
the
stern
st
good
night
the
idea
dates
from
time
immemorial
pliny
says
in
the
tenth
book
of
his
natural
history
that
the
scritch
owle
betokeneth
alwaies
some
heavie
newes
and
is
most
execrable
and
accursed
he
keepeth
ever
in
the
deserts
and
loveth
not
only
such
unpeopled
places
but
also
those
that
are
horrible
hard
of
accesse
in
summer
he
is
the
verie
monster
of
the
night
neither
crying
nor
singing
out
cleare
but
uttering
a
certaine
heavie
grone
of
dolefull
moning
and
therefore
if
he
be
seene
within
citties
or
otherwise
abroad
in
any
place
it
is
not
for
good
but
prognosticateth
some
fearfull
misfortune
raven
like
again
the
owl
is
a
specific
for
the
gout
all
that
is
necessary
being
to
take
an
owl
pull
off
her
feathers
salt
her
well
for
a
weak
then
put
her
into
a
pot
and
stop
it
close
and
put
her
into
an
oven
that
so
she
may
be
brought
into
a
mummy
this
has
then
to
be
beaten
into
a
powder
and
mixed
with
boar
s
grease
and
the
grieved
place
well
anointed
with
this
preparation
owl
broth
has
in
many
rural
districts
of
england
been
regarded
as
invaluable
in
whooping
cough
the
notion
of
stones
of
mystic
virtue
being
found
in
divers
animals
is
a
very
common
one
in
ancient
and
medi
val
lore
we
have
already
referred
to
the
raven
stone
and
many
others
were
sought
after
the
interior
of
a
fowl
was
said
to
yield
a
precious
stone
called
alectorius
the
chelidonius
came
from
a
swallow
geranites
from
a
crane
and
draconites
from
a
dragon
while
corvia
was
the
name
of
the
stone
obtained
from
the
crow
anyone
who
cares
to
penetrate
farther
into
this
mass
of
rubbish
will
find
plenty
of
it
in
the
mirror
of
stones
of
camillus
a
stone
from
the
hoopoe
when
laid
upon
the
breast
of
a
sleeping
man
forced
him
to
reveal
any
rogueries
he
might
have
committed
the
swallow
was
believed
by
some
people
to
have
two
of
these
precious
stones
stowed
away
somewhere
in
its
interior
one
of
these
was
a
red
one
and
cured
insanity
while
the
other
a
black
one
brought
good
fortune
others
said
that
the
swallow
found
by
some
inspiration
a
particular
kind
of
stone
on
the
seashore
and
that
this
stone
restored
sight
to
the
blind
it
will
be
remembered
that
longfellow
in
his
evangeline
refers
to
this
fancy
in
the
lines
seeking
with
eager
eyes
that
wondrous
stone
which
the
swallow
brings
from
the
shore
of
the
sea
to
restore
the
sight
of
her
fledglings
hence
people
assumed
not
unreasonably
that
what
the
bird
found
of
such
value
to
its
young
ones
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
of
equal
value
for
suffering
humanity
sometimes
the
association
of
the
swallow
with
blindness
is
much
more
recondite
thus
marcellus
writing
in
the
year
of
our
era
a
d
advises
one
who
fears
that
he
is
going
blind
to
look
out
for
the
first
swallow
then
run
silently
to
the
nearest
spring
wash
your
eyes
and
pray
god
that
you
may
be
free
from
it
that
year
and
then
with
the
callousness
that
is
so
characteristic
of
so
many
of
these
folk
lore
remedies
very
needlessly
adds
and
that
all
the
pain
may
pass
into
the
swallow
on
referring
to
our
copy
of
winstanley
s
book
of
knowledge
edition
of
to
find
out
how
far
he
confirms
these
wondrous
cures
of
insanity
impecuniosity
and
ophthalmia
we
find
that
he
does
not
even
recognize
their
existence
but
supplies
in
their
place
other
facts
equally
striking
take
a
swallow
on
the
wednesday
he
writes
and
bind
him
with
a
silken
thread
by
the
foot
then
cut
him
in
the
midst
and
thou
shalt
find
three
stones
a
white
a
red
and
a
green
take
the
white
and
put
it
into
thy
mouth
and
it
shall
make
thee
fair
put
into
thy
mouth
the
red
and
thou
shalt
have
favour
from
her
thou
lovest
put
the
green
into
thy
mouth
and
thou
shalt
never
be
in
peril
if
none
of
these
inducements
prevail
or
appeal
to
the
reader
the
author
can
supply
another
recipe
of
equal
value
take
a
swallow
in
the
moneth
of
august
look
in
her
breast
and
you
shall
find
there
a
stone
of
the
bignesse
of
a
pease
take
it
and
put
it
under
your
tongue
and
you
shall
have
such
eloquence
that
no
man
shall
have
power
to
deny
thy
request
such
a
gift
would
often
be
invaluable
and
it
seems
distinctly
unfortunate
for
the
legal
profession
that
it
can
only
be
utilised
during
the
long
vacation
unless
indeed
this
wondrous
stone
can
be
in
some
way
preserved
without
losing
its
efficacy
but
of
this
the
recipe
gives
no
hint
in
an
old
receipt
book
before
us
oil
of
swallows
is
pronounced
exceeding
soveraign
for
broken
bones
or
any
grief
in
the
sinews
it
is
procured
by
pounding
the
swallows
in
a
mortar
and
adding
thereto
divers
herbs
for
one
that
is
or
will
be
drunken
it
is
well
to
have
at
hand
some
preparation
that
may
be
deterrent
and
here
is
the
very
thing
take
swallowes
and
burne
them
and
make
a
powder
of
them
and
give
the
dronken
man
thereof
to
drinke
and
he
shall
never
be
dronken
hereafter
there
is
a
certain
sense
of
incompleteness
here
as
one
does
not
quite
realize
how
this
powder
becomes
drinkable
the
ill
luck
that
attended
those
who
hurt
the
robin
or
the
wren
was
an
article
of
faith
with
our
forefathers
and
probably
still
remains
so
in
rural
districts
in
the
six
pastorals
written
in
the
year
we
find
the
belief
very
clearly
expressed
in
the
lines
i
found
a
robin
s
nest
within
our
shed
and
in
the
barn
a
wren
has
young
ones
bred
i
never
take
away
their
nest
nor
try
to
catch
the
old
ones
lest
a
friend
should
die
dick
took
a
wren
s
nest
from
the
cottage
side
and
ere
a
twelvemonth
pass
d
his
mother
dy
d
the
belief
that
they
with
leaves
and
flowers
do
cover
the
friendless
bodies
of
unburied
men
has
no
doubt
had
much
to
do
with
the
kindly
feeling
extended
to
them
as
drayton
hath
it
covering
with
moss
the
dead
s
unclosed
eye
the
little
red
breast
teacheth
charity
its
fearless
confidence
too
in
visiting
the
habitations
of
men
has
begotten
a
kindly
feeling
for
it
while
one
ancient
legend
tells
us
that
when
our
saviour
hung
forsaken
on
the
cross
the
robin
strove
to
draw
out
the
cruel
nails
and
thus
imbrued
its
breast
in
the
sacred
blood
an
act
of
piety
of
which
from
thenceforth
it
bore
the
token
in
its
ruddy
feathers
though
there
are
divers
quaint
beliefs
associated
with
the
wren
which
we
need
not
here
particularize
we
may
perhaps
assume
that
the
main
reason
for
its
association
with
the
robin
lies
in
the
love
of
alliteration
for
though
the
actual
spelling
of
the
words
is
against
this
theory
the
sound
to
the
ear
favours
it
and
the
two
r
s
of
the
robin
and
the
ren
are
certainly
not
more
far
fetched
than
the
three
r
s
that
were
once
held
to
cover
the
whole
field
of
rustic
scholarship
reading
riting
and
rithmetic
the
eyes
and
heart
of
a
nightingale
laid
about
men
in
bed
according
to
the
magick
of
kirani
serve
to
keep
them
awake
and
to
make
one
die
for
sleep
if
anyone
dissolve
them
and
give
them
secretly
to
anyone
in
drink
he
will
never
sleep
but
will
so
die
and
it
admits
of
no
cure
it
was
a
belief
in
the
middle
ages
and
termed
the
doctrine
of
signatures
that
every
plant
bore
stamped
upon
itself
though
men
s
eyes
were
in
some
cases
too
blind
to
detect
it
an
indication
of
its
value
to
humanity
thus
the
spots
in
the
inside
of
a
foxglove
flower
were
a
sign
that
this
plant
was
of
value
for
ulcerated
sore
throat
the
buds
of
the
forget
me
not
bent
round
in
a
spiral
somewhat
suggestive
possibly
of
the
tail
of
a
scorpion
gave
the
plant
its
medi
val
name
of
scorpion
grass
and
were
held
a
clear
indication
that
anyone
stung
by
a
scorpion
would
find
in
this
herb
his
remedy
in
a
like
spirit
we
see
that
the
eyes
and
heart
of
the
nightingale
a
bird
awake
when
most
other
creatures
are
sleeping
were
held
to
be
on
application
a
cause
of
wakefulness
to
anyone
coming
within
their
subtle
influence
it
was
a
very
common
and
widespread
belief
that
the
nightingale
when
singing
pierced
its
breast
with
a
thorn
but
whether
this
was
to
keep
it
awake
or
to
give
its
song
the
sad
character
that
the
poets
will
insist
most
wrongfully
in
attributing
to
it
seems
an
open
question
sir
philip
sidney
in
one
of
his
sonnets
appears
to
reflect
the
popular
belief
the
nightingale
as
soon
as
april
bringeth
unto
her
rested
sense
a
perfect
waking
while
late
bare
earth
proud
of
her
clothing
springeth
sings
out
her
woes
a
thorn
her
song
book
making
and
mournfully
bewailing
her
throat
in
times
expresseth
while
grief
her
heart
oppresseth
the
author
of
the
speculum
mundi
also
refers
to
the
nightingale
sitting
all
the
night
singing
upon
a
bough
with
the
sharp
end
of
a
thorn
against
her
breast
assigning
as
the
reason
to
keep
her
waking
the
bird
is
a
great
favourite
with
the
poets
but
in
most
cases
their
invocations
are
somewhat
misplaced
it
is
not
the
sweet
songstress
that
so
delights
us
for
though
her
notes
are
sweet
the
real
flood
of
melody
wells
from
the
heart
of
her
lord
tis
he
to
quote
the
words
of
coleridge
that
crowds
and
hurries
and
precipitates
with
thick
fast
warble
his
delicious
notes
as
he
were
fearful
that
an
april
night
would
be
too
short
for
him
to
utter
forth
his
love
chant
and
disburden
his
full
soul
of
all
its
music
the
error
as
to
sex
and
the
error
as
to
the
pensive
character
of
the
song
have
a
common
origin
and
date
back
from
the
ancient
time
when
ovid
declared
that
philomela
the
daughter
of
pandion
king
of
athens
mourning
for
her
children
was
turned
into
a
nightingale
hence
virgil
uses
the
word
philomela
when
speaking
of
the
bird
and
the
medi
val
and
modern
poets
have
continued
the
usage
and
on
this
same
account
the
song
of
the
nightingale
has
by
poetic
fiction
been
deemed
pensive
and
melancholy
thus
shelley
refers
to
the
nightingale
s
complaint
and
drayton
writes
of
our
mournful
philomela
while
milton
calls
the
bird
most
musical
most
melancholy
coleridge
clare
and
others
refuse
however
to
follow
this
precedent
when
the
peasant
of
medi
val
days
heard
the
cuckoo
for
the
first
time
in
each
year
he
rolled
himself
vigorously
on
the
grass
and
thus
secured
himself
for
the
rest
of
the
year
from
pains
in
the
back
much
of
the
virtue
of
this
remedy
we
should
imagine
would
depend
upon
how
damp
the
grass
might
be
we
could
easily
imagine
a
state
of
things
when
this
rolling
process
would
be
provocative
rather
than
preventative
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
cuckoo
sucked
the
eggs
of
other
birds
the
cuckoo
he
sings
in
the
spring
of
the
year
and
he
sucks
little
birds
eggs
to
make
his
voice
clear
hence
so
soon
as
the
general
nesting
season
is
over
and
this
selfish
ovisuction
fails
him
the
cuckoo
to
a
great
extent
loses
his
song
it
was
a
generally
accepted
belief
too
that
the
cuckoo
repaid
the
care
of
his
foster
parents
when
he
had
no
further
occasion
for
it
by
swallowing
them
this
belief
dates
from
very
early
times
aristotle
refers
to
it
for
instance
while
in
later
days
it
crops
up
in
the
various
books
on
so
called
natural
history
on
turning
again
to
shakespeare
who
rarely
fails
us
when
any
quaint
folk
lore
has
to
be
illustrated
we
find
an
interesting
reference
to
it
in
king
lear
the
hedge
sparrow
fed
the
cuckoo
so
long
that
it
had
its
head
bit
off
by
its
young
and
again
in
the
first
part
of
king
henry
iv
where
worcester
reminding
the
king
of
his
broken
word
says
and
being
fed
by
us
you
used
us
so
as
that
ungentle
gull
the
cuckoo
s
bird
useth
the
sparrow
did
oppress
our
nest
grew
by
our
feeding
to
so
great
a
bulk
that
even
our
love
durst
not
come
near
your
sight
for
fear
of
swallowing
those
it
was
believed
who
turned
their
money
over
in
their
pockets
when
they
each
year
first
heard
the
cuckoo
would
have
good
fortune
throughout
the
rest
of
the
year
and
keep
their
pockets
well
supplied
until
the
recurring
spring
necessitated
a
re
turning
of
the
contents
it
was
a
curious
fancy
of
many
of
the
old
writers
on
such
matters
that
the
peacock
though
arrayed
in
such
splendour
was
ashamed
of
his
feet
the
mortification
at
the
latter
being
more
than
a
set
off
to
his
pride
in
his
plumage
the
peacock
says
for
instance
one
of
these
ancient
authorities
is
a
bird
well
known
and
much
admired
for
his
daintie
coloured
feathers
which
when
he
spreads
them
against
the
sunne
have
a
curious
lustre
and
look
like
gemmes
howbeit
his
black
feet
make
him
ashamed
of
his
fair
tail
and
therefore
when
he
seeth
them
as
angrie
with
nature
or
grieved
for
that
deformitie
he
hangeth
down
his
starrie
plumes
and
walketh
slowly
in
a
discontented
fit
of
solitary
sadnesse
like
one
possest
with
dull
melancholy
the
peacock
was
throughout
the
middle
ages
the
symbol
of
pride
and
doubtless
those
who
started
and
those
who
accepted
such
a
story
as
this
saw
in
it
a
happy
illustration
of
the
haughty
spirit
that
goeth
before
a
fall
and
very
gladly
added
it
to
the
great
body
of
moral
teaching
that
the
works
of
creation
were
required
to
furnish
a
large
mass
of
legend
and
folk
lore
is
associated
with
the
halcyon
or
kingfisher
one
curious
old
superstition
is
that
if
a
dead
kingfisher
is
suspended
from
the
roof
it
will
always
turn
its
breast
in
the
direction
from
which
the
wind
blows
on
looking
over
any
old
works
on
natural
history
one
is
repeatedly
struck
by
the
way
in
which
the
writers
all
copy
each
other
and
reproduce
the
most
outrageous
statements
without
ever
seeming
to
care
to
bring
the
matters
they
deal
with
to
the
easy
test
of
actual
proof
it
is
therefore
the
more
refreshing
to
find
the
old
writer
sir
thomas
browne
the
author
of
the
enquiry
into
vulgar
errors
very
wisely
declining
to
accept
the
statement
without
proof
but
actually
getting
a
kingfisher
for
himself
and
seeing
what
would
befall
his
reflections
and
experience
are
so
graphically
and
quaintly
given
in
his
book
that
we
make
no
apology
for
transferring
them
to
our
own
pages
he
says
that
a
kingfisher
hanged
by
the
bill
sheweth
in
what
quarter
the
winde
is
by
an
occult
and
secret
property
converting
the
breast
to
that
point
of
the
horizon
from
whence
the
winde
doth
blow
is
a
received
opinion
and
very
strange
introducing
naturall
weathercocks
and
extending
magneticall
positions
as
far
as
animall
natures
a
conceit
supported
chiefly
by
present
practice
yet
not
made
out
by
reason
or
experience
unto
reason
it
seemeth
very
repugnant
that
a
carcasse
or
body
disanimated
should
be
so
affected
by
every
winde
as
to
carry
a
conformable
respect
and
constant
habitude
thereto
for
although
in
sundry
animals
we
deny
not
a
kinde
of
naturall
meteorology
or
innate
pr
sention
bothe
of
winde
and
weather
yet
that
proceeding
from
sense
receiving
impressions
from
the
first
mutations
of
the
air
they
cannot
in
reason
retain
their
apprehension
after
death
as
being
affections
which
depend
upon
life
and
depart
upon
disanimation
and
therefore
with
more
favourable
reason
may
we
draw
the
same
effect
or
sympathie
upon
the
hedgehog
whose
pr
sention
of
windes
is
so
exact
that
it
stoppeth
the
north
or
southern
hole
of
its
nest
according
to
prenotion
of
these
windes
ensuing
which
some
men
observing
have
been
able
to
make
predictions
whiche
way
the
winde
should
turn
and
been
esteemed
hereby
wise
men
in
point
of
weather
now
this
proceeding
from
sense
in
the
creature
alive
it
were
not
reasonable
to
hang
up
an
hedgehog
dead
and
to
expect
a
conformable
motion
unto
its
living
conversion
thus
glowe
wormes
alive
project
a
lustre
in
the
dark
which
fulgour
notwithstanding
ceaseth
after
death
and
thus
the
torpedo
which
being
alive
stupifies
at
a
distance
applied
after
death
produceth
no
such
result
as
for
experiment
we
cannot
make
it
out
by
any
we
have
attempted
for
if
a
single
kingfisher
be
hanged
up
with
silk
in
an
open
room
and
where
the
aire
is
free
it
observes
not
a
constant
respect
unto
the
winde
but
vainly
converting
doth
seldome
breast
it
right
if
two
be
suspended
in
the
same
room
they
will
not
regularly
conform
their
breasts
but
oftimes
respect
the
opposite
points
of
heaven
and
if
we
conceive
that
for
exact
exploration
they
should
be
suspended
where
the
air
is
quiet
and
unmoved
that
clear
of
impediment
they
may
more
freely
convert
upon
this
naturall
verticity
we
have
also
made
this
way
of
inquisition
suspending
them
in
large
and
spacious
glasses
closely
stopped
wherein
neverthelesse
we
observed
a
casuall
station
and
that
they
rested
irregularly
upon
conversion
it
was
formerly
held
that
if
the
dead
bodies
of
these
birds
were
put
away
in
chests
they
protected
garments
from
the
ravages
of
moths
and
it
was
believed
that
the
feathers
of
a
dead
kingfisher
were
renewed
in
all
their
splendour
every
year
it
was
an
article
of
faith
too
that
the
plumage
of
the
kingfisher
was
injurious
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
gazed
too
long
and
too
intently
upon
it
while
the
possession
of
even
a
feather
was
a
protection
against
lightning
according
to
the
old
greek
myth
halcyone
was
the
daughter
of
olus
her
husband
ceyx
king
of
trachyn
was
drowned
in
the
gean
sea
and
the
widowed
halcyone
wandering
on
the
shore
saw
afar
the
dead
body
of
her
husband
the
gods
in
pity
turned
her
into
a
bird
which
with
eager
wings
bore
her
spirit
across
the
waste
of
waters
and
that
ceyx
might
be
able
to
return
the
love
she
lavished
upon
him
he
too
was
permitted
the
same
transformation
it
was
an
old
belief
that
during
the
space
of
fourteen
days
while
the
young
kingfishers
were
being
hatched
a
great
calm
fell
upon
all
things
and
this
period
of
quietness
and
security
is
referred
to
by
many
of
our
writers
a
very
beautiful
illustration
may
be
found
in
milton
s
hymn
on
the
nativity
where
he
describes
how
peaceful
was
the
night
wherein
the
prince
of
light
his
reign
of
peace
upon
the
earth
began
the
winds
with
wonder
whist
smoothly
the
waters
kiss
d
whispering
new
joys
to
the
wild
ocean
which
now
hath
quite
forgot
to
rave
while
birds
of
calm
sit
brooding
on
the
charmed
wave
the
word
halcyon
is
greek
and
signifies
brooding
on
the
sea
as
it
was
formerly
believed
that
the
kingfisher
laid
its
eggs
in
a
floating
nest
upon
the
sea
drayton
writes
for
example
of
the
halcyon
whom
the
sea
obeys
when
she
her
nest
upon
the
water
lays
while
dryden
to
quote
one
more
instance
says
amidst
our
arms
as
quiet
you
shall
be
as
halcyon
brooding
on
a
winter
s
sea
this
exceptional
favour
fair
halcyone
owes
to
her
close
relationship
with
olus
since
with
him
rested
the
power
to
lash
the
waves
to
fury
or
to
soothe
them
to
rest
this
beautiful
greek
myth
doubtless
underlies
the
superstition
as
to
the
dead
body
of
the
kingfisher
indicating
the
direction
of
the
wind
though
probably
it
never
occurs
to
the
rustic
meteorologist
as
he
watches
his
revolving
kingfisher
that
any
idea
of
the
loving
halcyone
turning
to
greet
the
coming
olus
enters
into
the
philosophy
of
his
test
it
was
for
centuries
a
belief
that
storks
fed
with
filial
care
their
aged
parents
thus
heywood
writing
in
the
year
asserts
in
the
hierachie
of
the
blessed
angells
that
the
indulgent
storke
who
builds
her
nest
on
hye
observ
d
for
her
alternat
pietie
doth
cherish
her
unfeather
d
young
and
feed
them
and
looks
from
them
the
like
when
she
should
need
them
that
s
when
she
grows
decrepit
old
and
weake
nor
doth
her
pious
issue
cov
nant
breeke
for
unto
her
being
hungry
food
she
brings
and
being
weake
supports
her
on
her
wings
one
meets
with
the
same
notion
again
in
beaumont
where
he
asserts
that
the
stork
s
an
emblem
of
true
piety
because
when
age
has
seized
and
made
his
dam
unfit
for
flight
the
grateful
young
one
takes
his
mother
on
his
back
provides
her
food
repaying
thus
her
tender
care
for
him
ere
he
was
fit
to
fly
the
extraordinary
idea
that
storks
were
found
only
in
countries
having
a
republican
form
of
government
held
its
ground
for
a
considerable
time
though
it
would
appear
as
though
nothing
could
have
been
simpler
than
its
prompt
disproof
cranes
it
was
believed
bore
stones
with
them
when
they
were
migrating
in
order
that
they
might
not
be
swept
out
of
their
course
by
the
wind
a
somewhat
parallel
notion
was
that
swallows
in
their
annual
migrations
carried
in
their
bills
when
about
to
cross
the
sea
a
piece
of
stick
to
be
laid
upon
the
water
from
time
to
time
as
a
convenient
resting
place
the
idea
of
the
cranes
steadying
themselves
in
flight
by
a
ballasting
of
small
rock
was
too
quaintly
happy
a
conception
not
to
bear
amplification
so
we
find
that
the
bees
the
never
failing
emblems
of
industry
and
wisdom
were
equally
ready
to
avail
themselves
of
the
notion
bees
that
are
emploied
in
carrying
of
honie
chuse
alwaies
to
have
the
wind
with
them
if
they
can
if
haply
there
do
arise
a
tempest
whiles
they
bee
abroad
they
catch
up
some
little
stonie
greet
to
ballaise
and
poise
themselves
against
the
wind
some
say
that
they
take
it
and
lay
it
upon
their
shoulders
how
the
little
stony
grit
maintains
this
latter
position
the
old
authors
do
not
stop
to
explain
in
the
georgics
of
virgil
we
find
a
reference
to
this
which
evidently
even
then
was
an
old
and
unchallenged
belief
in
the
lines
and
oft
with
pebbles
like
a
balanced
boat
poised
through
the
air
on
even
pinions
float
and
the
idea
reappears
from
time
to
time
as
a
fact
in
natural
history
there
is
so
much
that
is
legitimately
wonderful
in
bee
arrangements
that
it
is
scarcely
strange
that
some
of
the
details
given
by
ancient
and
medi
val
naturalists
in
praise
of
their
sagacity
and
other
estimable
qualities
should
overreach
the
possibilities
and
fail
in
the
not
unimportant
element
of
truth
the
sagacious
cranes
seem
to
have
found
several
valuable
uses
for
their
pieces
of
rock
we
are
told
that
while
the
main
body
are
resting
at
night
sentinels
are
posted
to
guard
against
surprise
so
that
the
flock
or
covey
or
whatever
else
may
be
the
proper
technical
term
to
use
rest
in
full
assurance
of
safety
to
insure
the
necessary
vigilance
these
sentinels
stand
upon
one
foot
and
hold
in
the
other
a

the

by
the
slight
noise
it
makes
awakens
them
to
a
proper
sense
of
their
duty
and
their
temporary
lapse
from
it
a
third
valuable
use
that
the
cranes
seem
to
have
found
for
stones
was
to
put
them
in
their
mouths
when
migrating
so
that
thus
gagged
they
might
not
make
a
noise
and
by
their
cries
bring
the
eagles
and
other
birds
of
prey
upon
themselves
in
the
euphues
we
find
a
passage
that
admirably
illustrates
the
belief
in
these
two
latter
uses
of
the
stone
as
the
author
would
naturally
not
use
similes
that
would
be
unfamiliar
to
his
readers
what
i
haue
done
he
writes
was
onely
to
keep
myselfe
from
sleepe
as
the
crane
doth
the

in
hir
foote
and
i
would
also
with
the
same
crane
that
i
had
been
silent
holding
a
stone
in
my
mouth
it
will
be
sufficiently
evident
that
the
birds
we
have
mentioned
are
but
few
in
number
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
make
our
treatment
exhaustive
extremely
easy
to
make
it
exhausting
we
would
desire
in
pity
to
our
readers
to
avoid
either
of
these
alternatives
we
would
therefore
steer
straight
for
the
proverbial
third
course
and
trust
that
it
may
be
held
that
we
have
found
a
happy
medium
in
resting

with

few

in

and
here
we
find
no
great
amount
of
material
to
deal
with
for
though
our
section
includes
such
fabulous
monsters
as
the
basilisk
and
the
dragon
the
general
knowledge
of
reptiles
and
fish
was
naturally
by
no
means
so
extensive
as
that
of
the
more
readily
visible
beasts
and
birds
the
basilisk
a
wingless
dragon
according
to
some
authorities
a
serpent
if
we
may
credit
others
was
a
peculiarly
objectionable
creation
not
of
nature
but
of
man
like
all
such
creatures
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
get
a
very
definite
idea
of
it
since
imagination
has
run
rampant
in
dealing
with
it
it
was
but
twelve
fingers
breadth
long
according
to
some
writers
this
we
may
take
to
mean
some
eight
or
nine
inches
long
but
unfortunately
its
powers
of
mischief
were
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
size
it
wore
a
diadem
upon
its
head
as
a
sign
of
its
kingship
over
all
other
serpents
and
its
poison
was
death
without
remedy
pliny
however
shall
be
allowed
to
describe
the
venomous
little
monster
in
his
own
way
as
he
does
so
with
a
vivid
force
that
it
is
impossible
to
surpass
with
his
hies
he
driveth
away
other
serpents
he
moveth
his
body
forward
not
by
multiplied
windings
like
other
serpents
but
he
goeth
with
half
his
body
upright
and
aloft
from
the
ground
he
killeth
all
shrubs
not
only
that
he
toucheth
but
that
he
breatheth
upon
he
burns
up
herbs
and
breaketh
the
stones
so
great
is
his
power
for
mischief
it
is
received
of
a
truth
that
one
of
them
being
killed
with
a
lance
by
a
man
on
horseback
the
poison
was
so
strong
that
it
passed
along
the
staff
and
destroyed
both
horse
and
man
its
touch
caused
the
flesh
to
fall
from
the
bones
of
the
animal
with
which
it
came
in
contact
and
even
the
glance
of
its
eye
was
death
upon
whomsoever
it
fell
it
will
be
remembered
that
shakespeare
refers
to
this
belief
in
the
utterance
of
the
lady
ann
in
response
to
richard
s
observation
on
her
eyes

that
they
were

s
seede
from

eyes
close

did
convey
into
the
looker
s

and

farre
away
the
writer
of
the
speculum
mundi
hath
it
that
the
basilisk
is
the
king
of
serpents
not
for
his
magnitude
nor
greatnesse
but
for
his
stately
pace
and
magnanimous
minde
of
this
magnanimity
however
he
gives
no
illustration
or
proof
but
simply
goes
on
to
give
the
creature
as
black
a
character
as
all
other
writers
do
his
eyes
are
red
in
a
kinde
of
cloudy
thicknesse
as
if
fire
were
mixt
with
smoke
his
poyson
is
a
very
hot
and
venimous
poyson
drying
up
and
scorching
the
grasse
as
if
it
were
burned
infecting
the
aire
round
about
him
so
as
no
other
creature
can
live
near
him
his
hissing
likewise
is
said
to
be
as
bad
in
regard
that
it
blasteth
trees
killeth
birds
c
by
poysoning
of
the
aire
and
if
anything
be
slaine
by
it
the
same
also
proueth
venimous
to
such
as
touch
it
an
altogether
unloving
and
unlovely
brute
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
whilst
we
in
this
nineteenth
century
simply
regard
such
a
creature
as
a
weird
fancy
countless
generations
of
mankind
have
accepted
the
basilisk
as
a
very
grim
reality
indeed
that
might
in
all
its
fearful
power
some
day
cross
their
paths
even
sir
thomas
browne
who
demolished
in
his
book
so
many
common
beliefs
is
prepared
to
accept
the
basilisk
for
while
he
declares
that
many
opinions
are
passant
concerning
the
basilisk
or
little
king
of
serpents
some
affirming
others
denying
most
doubting
the
relations
made
thereof
he
himself
adds
that
such
an
animal
there
is
if
we
evade
not
the
testimony
of
scripture
and
humane
writers
we
cannot
safely
deny
for
his
scriptural
proofs
he
quotes
psalm
xci
super
aspidem
et
basilicum
ambulabis
and
jeremiah
viii
ver
for
behold
i
will
send
serpents
cockatrices
among
you
which
will
not
be
charmed
and
they
shall
bite
you
many
of
the
old
writers
we
may
mention
in
passing
consider
the
basilisk
and
the
cockatrice
the
same
creature
that
by
death
dealing
glance
a
basilisk
may
empoison
is
not
to
browne
a
thing
impossible
for
eies
receive
offensive
impressions
from
their
objects
and
may
have
influences
destructive
to
each
other
for
the
visible
species
of
things
strike
not
our
senses
immaterially
but
streaming
in
corporall
raies
doe
carry
with
them
the
qualities
of
the
object
from
whence
they
flow
thus
it
is
not
impossible
what
is
affirmed
of
this
animall
the
visible
raies
of
their
eies
carrying
forth
the
subtilest
portion
of
their
poison
which
received
by
the
eie
of
man
or
beast
infecteth
first
the
brain
and
is
thence
communicated
to
the
heart
again
he
says
that
deleterious
it
may
be
at
some
distance
and
destructive
without
corporall
contaction
there
is
no
high
improbability
and
he
proceeds
not
by
any
means
without
thought
or
shrewdness
to
give
reasons
for
his
belief
in
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
for
says
he
if
plagues
or
pestilentiall
atomes
have
been
conveyed
in
the
air
from
different
regions
if
men
at
a
distance
have
infected
each
other
if
the
shaddowes
of
some
trees
be
noxious
if
torpedoes
deliver
their
opinion
at
a
distance
and
stupifie
beyond
themselves
we
cannot
reasonably
deny
that
besides
our
grosse
and
restrained
poisons
requiring
contiguity
unto
their
actions
there
may
proceed
from
subtiller
seeds
more
agile
emanations
which
contemn
those
laws
and
invade
at
distance
unexpected
the
belief
in
the
dragon
was
one
of
the
articles
of
faith
of
our
ancestors
in
another
of
our
books
symbolism
in
christian
art
we
have
dwelt
at
considerable
length
upon
the
various
legends
in
which
the
dragon
figures
and
the
symbolic
use
made
of
the
monster
as
representative
of
the
evil
principle
that
all
are
called
upon
to
combat
but
our
forefathers
had
a
very
real
belief
in
the
veritable
existence
of
the
dragon
not
by
any
means
regarding
it
as
a
symbol
merely
a
figure
of
speech
or
apt
allegory
but
as
one
of
the
quite
definite
perils
that
the
adventurous
traveller
in
distant
lands
might
be
called
upon
to
face
while
preparations
of
the
dragon
were
a
recognized
feature
in
the
pharmacop
ia
scale
of
dragon
tooth
of
wolf
and
many
other
horrible
ingredients
are
found
in
the
witches
cauldron
in
macbeth
in
a
medi
val
work
we
are
told
that
the
turning
joint
in
the
chine
of
a
dragon
doth
promise
an
easy
and
favourable
access
into
the
presence
of
great
lords
one
can
only
wonder
why
this
should
be
all
clue
and
thread
of
connection
between
the
two
things
being
now
so
hopelessly
lost
we
must
not
however
forget
that
smile
now
as
we
may
at
this
there
was
a
time
when
our
ancestors
accepted
the
statement
with
the
fullest
faith
and
many
a
man
who
would
fain
have
pleaded
his
cause
before
king
or
noble
bewailed
with
hearty
regret
his
want
of
draconic
chine
the
turning
point
of
the
dragon
and
of
his
own
fortunes
another
valuable
recipe
runs
as
follows
take
the
taile
and
head
of
a
dragon
the
haire
growing
upon
the
forehead
of
a
lion
with
a
little
of
his
marrow

the
froth

all
these
together
with

of
leather
made
of

skin
with
the
sinewes

of
a
stag
partly
of
a
fallowe
deere
one
with
another
carry
this
about
with
you
and
it
will
work
wonders
it
seems
almost
a
pity
that
the
actual
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
possession
of
this
compound
are
not
more
clearly
defined
as
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
considerable
amount
of
trouble
would
be
involved
in
getting
the
various
materials
together
and
the
zeal
and
ardour
of
the
seeker
after
this
wonder
working
composition
would
be
somewhat
damped
by
doubt
as
to
its
actual
utility
medi
val
medicine
men
surely
must
have
been
somewhat
chary
of
adopting
the
now
familiar
legend
of
prescriptions
accurately
dispensed
when
the
onus
of
making
up
such
a
mixture
could
be
laid
upon
them
in
spite
of
the
familiarity
with
the
appearance
of
the
creature
that
the
obtaining
of
its
head
and
tail
would
suggest
the
various
authorities
differ
very
widely
in
describing
it
some
writers
say
that
dragons
are
of
a
yellow
fierie
colour
having
sharp
backs
like
saws
and
some
tell
us
that
their
scales
shine
like
silver
some
dragons
are
said
to
have
wings
and
no
feet
some
again
have
both
feet
and
wings
others
have
neither
one
nor
the
other
and
are
only
distinguished
from
the
common
sort
of
serpents
by
the
combs
growing
upon
their
heads
father

in

declares

john
leo
in
his
history
of
africa
says
that
the
dragon
is
the
progeny
of
the
eagle
and
wolf
others
affirm
that
it
is
generated
by
the
great
heat
of
india
or
springs
from
the
volcanoes
of
ethiopia
after
reading
about
almost
every
possible
variation
of
structure
that
is
open
to
a
dragon
winged
serpentine
two
legged
four
legged
and
the
like
it
is
rather
quaint
to
find
that
pliny
feels
that
there
is
a
point
after
all
where
one
must
draw
the
line
he
says
that
in
ethiopia
there
are
produced
as
great
dragons
as
in
india
being
twenty
cubits
long
but
i
chiefly
wonder
at
one
thing
why
juba
should
think
they
were
crested
this
suggestion
of
the
crass
ignorance
of
juba
was
certainly
a
little
hard
on
him
as
when
so
very
much
was
believed
a
crest
was
a
very
little
extra
item
to
credit
besides
as
a
matter
of
fact
dragons
as
such
ethiopian
or
otherwise
were
often
described
by
ancient
authorities
as
having
this
feature
it
really
seems
like
accepting
the
sheeted
spectre
of
the
country
churchyard
and
then
growing
sceptical
because
its
hollowed
turnip
head
was
still
crowned
with
a
little
of
the
foliage
that
rustic
haste
or
indifference
to
the
verities
had
failed
to
cut
away
aldrovandus
in
his
history
of
serpents
and
dragons
published
in
goes
very
thoroughly
indeed
into
the
subject
the
work
is
in
folio
size
and
the
portion
devoted
to
the
dragon
extends
from
pages
to
it
must
be
duly
noted
that
aldrovandus
entirely
accepts
the
dragon
as
a
reality
that
this
is
so
is
obvious
from
his
dealing
with
it
in
this
volume
instead
of
placing
it
in
his
historia
monstrorum
the
book
is
written
in
latin
and
amongst
the
various
sections
concerning
the
dragon
we
find
differenti

fig
our
ancestors
used
always
to
prescribe
divers
kinds
of
herb
teas
to
be
drunk
in
the
spring
time
and
it
is
a
curious
example
of
instinct
in
a
reptile
that
the
dragon
likewise
whom
he
feels
at
this
season
of
the
year
a
certain
loathing
of

himself
into
rude
health
again
with
the

of
the

many
animals
have

at
all
events

if
we
may
credit
the
wisdom
of
our
forefathers
considerable
faith
in
the
medicinal
value
of

thus
pigeons
and
blackbirds
when
suffering
from
loss

bay

for

the

the
elephant
when
he
had
inadvertently
swallowed
one
of
these
creatures
a
mistake
that
seems
to
have
not
unfrequently
happened
probably
from
the
resemblance
in
colour
of
the
reptile
to
the
foliage
amongst
which
he
was
ensconced
pinned
his
faith
in
the
wild
olive
leaf
as
the
toad
ugly
and
venomous
bore
yet
in
popular
belief
a
precious
jewel
in
its
head
so
we
find
in
the
writings
of
various
authorities
a
belief
that
the
still
uglier
and
more
venomous
dragon
bore
in
like
manner
the
lustrous
carbuncle
jordanus
tells
us
for
example
that
in
india
the
dragons
that
there
abound
are
thus
gifted
a
fact
that
the
natives
turn
to
their
advantage
these
dragons
he
declares
grow
exceeding
big
and
cast
forth
from
the
mouth
a
most
infectious
breath
like
the
thickest
smoke
rising
from
fire
these
animals
come
together
at
the
destined
time
develop
wings
and
begin
to
raise
themselves
in
the
air
and
then
by
the
judgment
of
god
being
too
heavy
they
drop
into
a
certain
river
which
issues
from
paradise
and
perish
there
but
all
the
regions
round
about
watch
for
the
time
of
the
dragons
and
when
they
see
that
one
has
fallen
they
wait
for
seventy
days
and
then
go
down
and
find
the
bare
bones
of
the
dragon
and
take
the
carbuncle
which
is
rooted
in
the
top
of
his
head
even
the
dragon
however
may
not
be
quite
so
black
as
he
is
painted
for
we
read
in
one
old
author
of
a
child
in
arcadia
that
had
a
dragon
for
its
playmate
there
was
much
affection
between
them
but
presently
a
considerable
dread
of
the
dragon
s
powers
gained
possession
of
the
boy
and
he
compassed
the
brilliant
idea
of
beguiling
his
companion
well
out
into
the
desert
and
then
slipping
away
in
the
very
consummation
of
this
plan
a
new
danger
arose
as
the
stripling
found
himself
in
an
ambush
of
robbers
whereupon
he
was
only
too
thankful
to
call
out
to
his
discarded
playmate
who
immediately
came
to
the
rescue
and
very
effectually
scattered
his
despoilers
at
this
point
the
history
unfortunately
stops
but
we
may
perhaps
conclude
that
it
follows
on
the
lines
of
most
stories
of
the
affections
and
that
they
lived
happy
ever
after
however
this
may
be
it
is
a
charming
narrative
and
opens
out
quite
a
new
trait
of
dragon
disposition
amongst
the
many
strange
creatures
that
were
held
to
inhabit
ethiopia
the
griffins
were
perhaps
the
most
conspicuous
amidst
the
weird
fauna
of
that
marvellous
land
some
men
seyn
and
maundevile
in
his
quaint
book
of
travels
fully
endorses
the
idea
that
griffounes
han
the
body
upward
as
an
egle
and
benethe
as
a
lyoun
and
treuly

about

describes
the
griffin
in

sober
earnestness
as
a
bird
with
four
feet
of
the
size
of
a
wolf
and
having
the
legs
and
claws
of
a
lion
their
feathers
being
red
upon
the

and
black
on
the
rest
of
the
body
glanvil
says
of
it
the
claws
of
a
griffin
are
so
large
and
ample
that
he
can
seize
an
armed
man
as
easily
by
the
body
as
a
hawk
a
little
bird
the
griffin
is
often
met
with
in
heraldry
past
and
present
either
as
a
crest
charge
or
supporter
of
the
arms
a
very
familiar
example
of
its
employment
in
the
latter
service
may
be
seen
in
the
arms
of
the
city
of
london
or
exalted
on
lofty
pedestal
where
in
lieu
of
temple
bar
it
marks
the
westward
civic
boundary
shakespeare
milton
and
others
of
our
poets
and
writers
refer
to
the
griffin
anyone
reading
the
herbals
of
gerard
parkinson
and
others
or
the
various
medical
books
of
the
middle
ages
will
scarcely
have
failed
to
notice
how
frequently
reference
is
made
to
the
scorpion
in
these
later
days
a
man
might
well
journey
from
john
o
groats
to
the
land

end
and
run
no
peril
of
an
encounter
but
in
the
earlier
times
we
have
referred
to
the
sting
of
the
scorpion
was
a
very
present
dread
and
numerous
remedies
for
it
were
devised

was
supposed
to
be
sufficiently
indicated
from

rolled

into

more

we
may
point
out
the
special
charm
that
our

seemed
to
find

anything
associated
with
the
charnel

thus
one
favourite
remedy
was
the

another

giving

that

the

have
been
a
powerful
influence
in
checking
redundance
of
population
toads
were
in
great
repute
in
sickness
in
time
of
common
contagion
writes
sir
kenelm
digby
in
men
use
to
carry
about
with
them
the
powder
of
a
toad
and
sometimes
a
living
toad
or
spider
shut
up
in
a
box
which
draws
the
contagious
air
which
otherwise
would
infect
the
party
and
many
other
illustrations
of
their
employment
as
preventives
or
remedies
might
be
given
the
spider
and
the
toad
seem
to
have
been
each
regarded
as
most
venomous
creatures
and
in
many
of
the
old
remedies
one
or
other
of
them
at
will
are
recommended
either
alternative
being
regarded
as
equally
efficacious
thus
for
whooping
cough
if
one
cannot
find
a
toad
to
thrust
up
the
chimney
two
spiders
in
a
walnut
shell
will
serve
equally
well
there
was
held
to
be
mortal
antipathy
between
the
toad
and
the
spider
and
the
result
of
a
meeting
between
them
was
a
conflict
fatal
to
one
or
both
of
the
antagonists
the
aster
tripolium
a
well
known
english
wild
plant
was
originally
called
the
toad
wort
when
a
spider
stings
a
toad
and
the
toad
is
becoming
vanquished
and
the
spider
stings
it
thickly
and
frequently
and
the
toad
cannot
avenge
itself
it
bursts
assunder
at
least
the
author
of
the
ortus
sanitatis
says
it
does
but
whether
this
arises
from
venom
or
from
vexation
he
does
not
explain
if
such
a
burst
toad
be
near
the
toad
wort
it
chews
it
and
becomes
sound
again
but
if
it
happens
that
the
wounded
toad
cannot
get
to
the
plant
another
toad
fetches
it
and
gives
it
to
the
wounded
one
topsell
in
his
natural
history
vouches
for
this
having
been
actually
witnessed
that
the
skin
of
the
toad
gives
forth
an
acrid
secretion
which
serves
the
creature
as
a
defence
is
established
beyond
doubt
but
its
hurtful
properties
have
been
greatly
exaggerated
dryden

to
the
lady
who
squeezed
a
toad
into
her

the
inference

she
was
in

murderous
spenser
makes

putrefying

lily
in
his
euphues
declares
that
the
foule

hath
a
faire
stone
in

an
idea
that
shakespeare
has
immortalized
in
the
beautiful
lines
that
remind
us
how
sweet
are
the
uses
of
adversity
which
like
the
toad
ugly
and
venomous
yet
wears
a
precious
jewel
in
its
head
the
crapaudine
or
toad
stone
is
of
a
dull
brown
colour
it
was
believed
to
possess
sovereign
virtue
against
poison
from
its
changing
colour
when
in
the
presence
of
any
noxious
thing
hence
it
was
often
worn
as
a
protection
in
finger
rings

this
use

collection
the
belief
in
the
virtues
of
the
toad
stone
was
not
only
popular
in
england
but
was
one
of
the
fallacies
accepted
throughout
europe
though
the
stone
is
well
known
to
geologists
as
a
variety
of
trap
rock
the
accepted
belief
was
that
it
was
found
only
in
the
head
of
the
toad
fenton
writing
in
affirms
that
there
is
found
in
the
heads
of
old
and
great
toads
a
stone
which
they
call
borax
or
stelon
and
lupton
some
fifty
years
afterwards
writes
the
crepaudia
or
toad
stone
is
very
valuable
touching
any
part
envenomed
by
the
bite
of
a
rat
wasp
spider
or
other
poisonous
beast
it
ceases
the
pain
and
swelling
thereof
ben
jonson
also
refers
to
it
in
his
play
of
the
fox
albertus
magnus
writing
about
adds
the
great
wonder
that
this
stone
when
taken
out
of
the
creature
s
head
has
the
figure
of
a
toad
upon
it
while
others
declare
that
the
stone
itself
is
of
the
form
of
a
toad
it
is
a
treasure
not
easily
to
be
procured
for
the
toad
envieth
much
that
man
should
haue
that
stone
declares
lupton
the
author
of
a
thousand
notable
things
hence
it
was
very
necessary
to
beware
of
useless
counterfeits
and
this
old
writer
gives
us
a
ready
means
of
detecting
them
to
know
says
he
whether
the
toad
stone
called
crepaudia
be
the
righte
and
perfect
stone
or
not
holde
the
stone
before
a
toad
so
that
he
may
see
it
and
if
it
be
a
right
and
true
stone
the
toad
will
leap
towards
it
and
make
as
though
he
would
snatch
it
from
you
a
proceeding
that
must
have
required
a
considerable
amount
of
nerve
on
the
part
of
anyone
duly
impressed
with
the
fear
of
the
deadly
venom
of
the
creature
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
the
same
ancient
authority
on
the
subject
very
obligingly
gives
a
rare
good
way
to
get
the
stone
out
of
the
toad
it
suffices
to
put
a
great
or
overgrown
toad
first
bruised
in
divers
places
into
an
earthen
pot
put
the
same
into
an
ant
s
hillocke
and
cover
the
same
with
earth
which
toad
at
length
the
ants
will
eat
so
that
the
bones
of
the
toad
and
stone
will
be
left
in
the
pot
this
certainly
seems
simplicity
itself
but
unfortunately
most
authorities
agree
in
saying
that
the
stone
to
have
any
real
virtue
should
be
obtained
while
the
creature
is
yet
alive
porta
has
his
doubts
on
the
whole
matter
nevertheless
he
gives
some
hints
that
might
be
of
value
to
those
of
greater
faith
there
is
a
stone
he
says
called
chelonites
the
french
name
it
crapodina
which
they
report
to
be
found
in
the
head
of
a
great
old
toad
and
if
it
can
be
gotten
from
him
while
he
is
alive
it
is
soveraign
against
poyson
they
say
it
is
taken
from
living
toads
in
a
red
cloth
in
which
colour
they
are
much
delighted
for
while
they
sport
themselves
upon
the
scarlet
the
stone
droppeth
out
of
their
head
and
falleth
through
a
hole
made
in
the
middle
into
a
box
set
under
for
the
purpose
else
they
will
suck
it
up
again
but
i
never
met
with
a
faithfull
person
who
said
that
he
had
found
it
nor
could
i
ever
find
one
though
i
have
cut
up
many
nevertheless
i
will
affirm
this
for
truth
that
those
stones
which
are
pretended
to
be
taken
out
of
toads
are
minerals
but
the
value
is
certain
if
any
swallow
it
down
with
poyson
it
will
preserve
him
from
the
malignity
of
it
for
it
runneth
about
with
the
poyson
and
asswageth
the
power
of
it
that
it
becometh
vain
and
of
no
force
boethius
tells
us
how
he
watched
throughout
a
whole
night
an
old
toad
that
he
had
placed
on
a
piece
of
scarlet
cloth
but
is
obliged
to
confess
that
nothing
occurred
to
gratify
the
great
pangs
of
his
whole
night
s
restlessness
as
the
toad
entirely
declined
to
be
lured
into
any
frivolities
that
might
cause
him
the
loss
of
his
precious
jewel
browne
in
his
exposure
of
the
various
popular
errors
current
in
his
time
presently
arrives
at
this
belief
but
finds
himself
unable
to
express
any
very
definite
opinion
and
takes
refuge
in
compromise
as
for
the
stone
quoth
he
commonly
called
a
toad
stone
which
is
presumed
to
be
found
in
the
head
of
that
animall
we
first
conceive
it
not
a
thing
impossible
nor
is
there
any
substantiall
reason
why
in
a
toad
there
may
not
be
found
such
hard
and
lapideous
concretions
for
the
like
we
daily
observe
in
the
heads
of
fishes
as
codds
carps
and
pearches
though
it
be
not
impossible
yet
it
is
surely
very
rare
as
we
are
induced
to
believe
from
inquiry
of
our
own
from
the
triall
of
many
who
have
been
deceived
and
the
frustrated
search
of
porta
who
upon
the
explorement
of
many
could
scarce
finde
one
nor
is
it
only
of
rarity
but
may
be
doubted
whether
it
be
of
existency
or
really
any
such
stone
in
the
head
of
a
toad
at
all
for
though
lapidaries
and
questonary
enquires
affirm
it
yet
the
writers
of
mineralls
and
natural
speculators
are
of
another
belief
conceiving
the
stones
which
bear
this
name
to
be
a
minerall
concretion
not
to
be
found
in
animalls
but
in
fields
what
therefore
best
reconcileth
these
divided
determinations
may
be
a
middle
opinion
that
of
these
stones
some
are
minerall
and
to
be
found
in
the
earth
some
animall
to
be
met
with
in
toads
at
least
by
the
induration
of
their
cranies
the
first
are
many
and
manifold
to
be
found
in
germany
and
other
parts
the
last
are
fewer
in
number
and
in
substance
not
unlike
the
stones
in
carps
heads
this
is
agreeable
unto
the
determination
of
aldrovandus
and
is
also
the
judgment
of
the
learned
spigelius
in
his
epistle
unto
pignorius
if
only
a
toad
with
an
indurated
cranium
could
be
discovered
everything
would
fall
into
its
right
place
through
the
middle
ages
men
believed
that
the
toad
exercised
the
power
of
fascination
not
only
upon
its
insect
prey
but
upon
all
other
creatures
including
man
himself
and
even
so
far
back
as
the
days
of
the
classical
writers
it
was
a
fully
accepted
belief
that
whosoever
had
the
misfortune
to
be
looked
squarely
in
the
eyes
by
a
toad
would
find
that
basilisk
like
the
gaze
to
him
meant
death
the
belief
that
the
crocodile
shed
tears
over
his
prey
is
a
very
ancient
one
various
motives
have
been
assigned
for
this
grief
but
the
generally
accepted
belief
is
that
the
whole
proceeding
is
a
fraud
perpetrated
with
the
idea
of
attracting
sympathetic
passers
by
within
reach
of
his
formidable
jaws
hence
he
has
been
accepted
as
a
symbol
of
dissimulation
we
get
an
excellent
illustration
of
this
in
shakespeare
s
king
henry
viii
where
henry
is
said
by
queen
margaret
to
be
too
full
of
foolish
pity
and
gloster
s
show
beguiles
him
as
the
mournful
crocodile
with
sorrow
snares
relenting
passengers
spenser
in
the
faerie
queene
deals
equally
clearly
and
explicitly
with
the
same
fancy
in
the
lines
as
when
a
wearie
traveiler
that
strayes
by
muddy
shore
of
broad
seven
mouthed
nile
unweeting
of
the
perillous
wandring
wayes
doth
meete
a
cruell
craftie
crocodile
which
in
false
grefe
hyding
his
harmefull
guile
doth
weepe
full
sore
and
sheddeth
tender
teares
the
foolish
man
that
pities
all
this
while
his
mournful
plight
is
swallowed
up
unawares
forgetfull
of
his
owne
that
mindes
an
other
s
cares
thereupon
ungallantly
adds
an
old
writer
came
this
proverb
that
is
applied
unto
women
when
they
weep
lachrym
crocodili
the
meaning
whereof
is
that
as
the
crocodile
when
he
crieth
goeth
about
most
to
deceive
so
doth
a
woman
most
commonly
when
she
weepeth
thus
othello
misanthropically
exclaims
if
that
the
earth
could
teem
with
woman
s
tears
each
drop
she
falls
would
prove
a
crocodile
in
the
same
spirit
barnfield
in
his
cassandra
written
in
the
year
has
the
following
passage
he
noble
lord
fearlesse
of
hidden
treason
sweetely
salutes
this
weeping
crocodile
excusing
every
cause
with
instant
reason
they
kept
him
from
her
sight
so
long
a
while
she
faintly
pardons
him
smiling
by
art
for
life
was
in
her
lookes
death
in
her
hart
the
author
of
the
speculum
mundi
who
is
ever
seeking
a
moral
or
an
opportunity
of
improving
the
occasion
declares
that
the
crocodile
when
he
hath
devoured
a
man
and
eaten
all
up
but
the
head
will
sit
and
weep
over
it
as
if
he
expressed
a
great
portion
of
sorrow
for
his
cruel
feast
but
it
is
nothing
so
for
when
he
weeps
it
is
because
his
hungrie
paunch
wants
such
another
prey
and
from
hence
the
proverb
took
beginning
viz
crocodiles
tears
which
is
then
verified
when
one
weeps
cunningly
without
sorrow
dissembling
heaviness
out
of
craftinesse
like
unto
many
rich
men
s
heirs
who
mourn
in
their
gowns
when
they
laugh
in
their
sleeves
or
like
to
other
dissemblers
of
the
like
nature
who
have
sorrow
in
their
eyes
but
joy
and
craftiness
in
their
hearts
however
this
may
be
the
supposititious
tears
of
the
crocodile
have
been
turned
to
abundant
literary
and
moral
account
the
tears
of
the
crocodile
were
supposed
according
to
some
who
were
great
authorities
in
their
day
and
generation
to
crystallize
into
gems
but
as
supposititious
tears
could
only
produce
supposititious
gems
the
actual
value
would
be
but
small
in
an
early
bestiary
it
states
that
if
a
crocodile
comes
across
a
man
it
kills
him
but
it
remains
inconsolable
the
rest
of
its
life
but
why
it
suffers
this
life
long
remorse
we
are
not
told
this
old
writer
also
tells
us
of
the
hydra
a
very
wise
animal
who
understands
well
how
to
injure
the
crocodile
the
modus
operandi
is
very
simple
and
the
injury
inflicted
seems
beyond
question
when
the
hydra
sees
the
crocodile
go
to
sleep
it
covers
itself
over
with
slimy
mud
and
wriggles
itself
into
the
crocodile
s
mouth
penetrates
into
its
stomach
and
then
tears
it
assunder
the
dolphin
appears
to
be
another
foe
to
be
by
no
means
despised
pliny
tells
us
that
when
these
desire
to
pass
up
the
nile
the
crocodiles
who
regard
the
river
as
their
peculiar
preserve
greatly
resent
their
presence
and
endeavour
to
drive
them
back
as
the
dolphins
fully
realize
that
they
are
no
match
for
their
foes
in
fair
fight
they
take
refuge
in
their
superior
activity
and
craft
and
having
a
dorsal
fin
as
sharp
edged
as
a
knife
they
swim
swiftly
beneath
the
crocodiles
and
as
the
under
portion
of
these
creatures
is
unprotected
by
the
armour
that
is
so
conspicuous
on
the
upper
parts
of
their
bodies
with
one
sharp
gash
they
rip
the
crocodile
completely
open
it
was
a
greek
superstition
that
beneath
the
visible
exterior
of
the
seal
was
concealed
a
woman
and
that
when
a
swimmer
ventured
too
far
he
ran
great
risk
of
being
seized
by
a
seal
and
strangled
the
creature
then
carried
the
lifeless
body
to
some
desert
shore
and
wept
over
it
from
which
arose
the
popular
saying
that
when
a
woman
shed
false
tears
she
cried
like
a
seal
as
the
desert
shore
implies
absence
of
spectators
it
seems
difficult
to
tell
what
authority
there
is
for
the
statement
as
to
what
went
on
there
and
even
when
this
initial
difficulty
is
overcome
it
seems
equally
impossible
to
suggest
any
satisfactory
reason
for
the
gruesome
proceedings
of
this
weird
woman
seal
or
seal
woman
either
in
the
preliminary
murderous
attack
or
the
subsequent
lamentation
whatever
strange
idea
may
have
originally
started
the
story
it
is
a
curious
parallel
to
that
of
the
weeping
crocodile
the
salamander
received
its
full
mythical
development
in
medi
val
days
though
the
older
writers
refer
to
it
occasionally
and
we
note
in
the
writings
of
such
men
as
pliny
the
first
steps
taken
towards
the
erection
of
that
fabric
of
fancy
and
superstition
that
later
on
became
so
conspicuous
the
ancients
asserted
that
the
salamander
was
never
seen
in
bright
weather
but
only
made
its
appearance
during
heavy
rain
and
that
it
was
of
so
frigid
a
nature
that
if
it
did
but
touch
fire
it
quenched
it
as
completely
as
if
ice
were
piled
thereon
it
was
moreover
declared
to
be
so
venomous
that
the
mere
climbing
of
a
tree
by
the
animal
is
amply
sufficient
to
poison
all
the
fruit
so
that
those
who
afterwards
eat
thereof
perished
without
remedy
and
that
if
it
entered
a
river
the
stream
was
so
effectually
poisoned
that
all
who
drank
thereof
must
die
glanvil
an
english
writer
in
the
thirteenth
century
roundly
declares
as
historic
fact
that
four
thousand
men
and
two
thousand
horses
of
the
army
of
alexander
the
great
were
killed
by
drinking
from
a
stream
that
had
been
thus
infected
it
was
in
the
middle
ages
an
article
of
faith
that
the
salamander
was
bred
and
nourished
in
fire
hence
when
the
creature
is
represented
it
is
always
placed
in
the
midst
of
flames
our
illustration
fig
from
porta
is
a
fair
typical
example
how
the
creature
should
be
nourished
in
the
flames
while
its
mere
contact
with
them
suffices
to
extinguish
them
seems
a
practical
difficulty
but
the
contradiction
of
ideas
does
not
seem
to
have
troubled
our
forefathers
and
the
two
mutually
destructive
statements
rest
side
by
side
equally
unquestioned
in
the
writings
of
all
the
authorities
pliny
having
his
doubts
thrust
a
salamander
into
the
fire
and
the
unfortunate
victim
of
science
was
quickly
shrivelled
up
and
consumed
one
would
have
thought
that
this
crucial
test
of
actual
experiment
would
have
settled
the
whole
matter
and
reduced
the
fire
extinguishing
theory
to
oblivion
but
it
takes
much
more
than
that
to
kill
an
old
and
well
established
belief
as
we
may
see
even
in
our
own
day
where
many
superstitions
still
flourish
in
spite
of
common
sense
education
and
experience
arrayed
against
them
illustration
fig
de
thaun
in
his
bestiary
declares
that
the
salamander
is
of
such
a
nature
that
if
it
come
by
chance
where
there
shall
be
burning
fire
it
shall
at
once
extinguish
it
the
beast
is
so
cold
and
of
such
a
quality
that
fire
will
not
be
able
to
burn
where
it
shall
enter
nor
will
trouble
happen
where
it
shall
be
this
latter
statement
is
entirely
at
variance
with
the
general
belief
in
its
deadliness
but
all
these
statements
are
dwelt
on
exaggerated
or
suppressed
as
occasion
and
the
moral
to
be
deduced
requires
as
in
this
particular
case
the
pious
writer
desired
to
see
in
the
creature
an
emblem
of
azarias
ananias
and
misael
praising
god
without
hurt
in
the
fiery
furnace
any
reference
to
its
noxious
properties
was
clearly
out
of
place
and
on
the
strength
of
this
association
it
even
receives
a
somewhat
negative
form
of
commendation
on
its
virtues
as
a
peace
producer
this
we
are
bound
to
say
is
the
only
good
word
we
have
ever
seen
ascribed
by
any
of
the
writers
of
the
past
to
this
unfortunate
creature
and
it
beyond
doubt
only
receives
even
this
solitary
commendation
because
the
exigencies
of
what
the
old
writers
thought
the
greater
truth
appeared
to
call
for
it
asbestos
was
from
its
incombustible
property
long
held
to
be
the
wool
of
the
salamander
in
the
middle
ages
popular
imagination
was
greatly
exercised
over
a
mysterious
ruler
in
the
east
known
as
prester
john
he
was
held
to
be
a
christian
and
to
bear
sway
in
asia
over
a
widely
extended
empire
but
the
stories
of
returning
travellers
showed
that
the
idea
had
no
foundation
in
fact
and
the
scene
of
the
monarchy
was
then
shifted
to
abyssinia
the
first
reference
to
this
sovereign
would
appear
to
be
in
the
chronicle
of
one
otto
of
freisingin
who
wrote
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
and
afterwards
allusions
to
this
mysterious
monarch
frequently
recur
in
the
chronicle
of
albericus
about
a
hundred
years
later
than
that
of
otto
we
read
that
presbyter
joannes
sent
his
wonderful
letter
to
various
christian
princes
and
especially
to
manuel
of
constantinople
and
frederic
the
roman
emperor
in
this
letter
a
very
lengthy
one
he
claims
to
be
lord
of
lords
and
to
receive
the
tribute
and
homage
of
seventy
two
kings
in
the
three
indies
saith
he
our
magnificence
rules
and
our
land
extends
beyond
india
it
reaches
toward
the
sunrise
over
the
wastes
and
it
trends
towards
deserted
babylon
near
the
tower
of
babel
whatever
of
credence
much
or
little
we
may
give
to
this
letter
it
is
at
least
interesting
to
us
as
showing
the
set
of
opinion
on
amongst
other
matters
things
zoological
and
therefore
comes
within
the
scope
of
our
book
he
gives
many
details
as
to
the
plants
the
gold
and
precious
stones
and
so
forth
and
also
states
that
our
land
is
the
home

it
is
the
home
too
of
the

nix
and
of
nearly
all
living
animals
in
one
of
our
lands
hight
zone
are
worms
called
in
our
tongue
salamanders
these
worms
can
only
live
in
fire
and
they
build
cocoons
like
silkworms
which
are
unwound
by
the
ladies
of
our
palace
and
spun
into
cloth
and
dresses
which
are
worn
by
our
exaltedness
these
dresses
when
we
would
wash
them
and
clean
are
cast
into
flames
browne
in
his
exposure
of
vulgar
errors
gravely
denies
the
existence
of
wool
on
a
salamander
at
all
truly
pointing
out
that
it
is
a
kinde
of
lizard
a
quadruped
corticated
and
depilous
that
is
without
woolle
furre
or
haire
an
altogether
hopeless
animal
to
shear
porta
mentions
that
some
peculiar
creatures
called
pyragones
be
generated
in
the
fire
certain
little
flying
beasts
so
called
because
they
live
and
are
nourished
in
the
fire
and
yet
they
fly
up
and
down
in
the
air
this
is
strange
but
that
is
more
strange
that
as
soon
as
ever
they
come
out
of
the
fire
into
any
cold
air
presently
they
die
porta
of
course
uses
the
word
presently
in
the
older
sense
of
at
this
present
moment
so
that
it
really
is
as
he
says
a
wonder
that
these
creatures
are
able
to
fly
about
in
the
air
when
its
effect
upon
them
is
immediate
death
we
have
ourselves
been
gravely
told
that
if
the
fires
at
the
great
iron
works
in
the
midland
counties
were
not
occasionally
extinguished
an
uncertain
but
fearful
something
would
be
generated
in
them
and
it
seems
only
natural
that
after
the
imagination
has
peopled
earth
and
sea
with
strange
monsters
and
placed
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
air
the
paradise
birds
and
other
creatures
that
derived
all
needful
sustenance
from
that
element
alone
that
the
remaining
element
fire
should
also
have
its
peculiar
inhabitants
and
monsters
the
cham
leon
was
for
centuries
supposed
to
live
only
on
air
while
its
property
of
changing
colour
under
the
influence
of
its
surroundings
was
greatly
exaggerated
shakespeare
the
great
storehouse
of
medi
val
folk
lore
makes
speed
in
the
two
gentlemen
of
verona
exclaim
tho
the
cham

live
on
the
air
i
m
one
that

while

that
he
could
add

unto

camelion
whiche
upon

hence
again
other
moralists
declare
that
men
and
women
inconstant
and
fickle
are
like
unto
cham
leons
it
has
been
asserted
by
avicenna
that
a
decoction
of
cham
leon
put
into
a
bath
will
make
him
green
coloured
that
stayeth
long
therein
but
that
by
degrees
this
verdant
hue
will
pass
away
and
the
man
recover
his
natural
colour
while
porta
declares
that
with
the
gall
of
a
cham
leon
cut
into
water
wheezles
will
be
called
together
why
anyone
should
want
to
call
a
wheezle
together
he
does
not
explain
so
that
the
receipt
simple
as
it
is
seems
to
be
of
no
great
practical
value
it
has
been
rather
a
disgusting
belief
that
if
a
man
will
lick
a
lizard
all
over
he
will
not
only
be
safe
from
the
personal
inconvenience
of
having
a
lizard
go
down
his
throat
some
day
when
he
might
be
sleeping
in
the
fields
but
that
he
will
have
the
power
henceforward
of
healing
any
sore
to
which
he
applies
his
tongue
our
ancestors
held
many
strange
beliefs
respecting
serpents
and
snakes
one
of
these
was
they
were
created
from
hair
women
s
hairs
especially
as
one
old
writer
is
careful
to
emphasize
because
they
are
naturally
longer
than
men
s
one
old
authority
our
oft
quoted
porta
hesitates
not
to
say
that
we
have
experienced
also
that
the
hairs
of
a
horse
s
mane
laid
in
the
waters
become
serpents
and
our
friends
have
tried
the
same
and
he
goes
on
to
mention
as
a
truism
to
be
almost
apologized
for
from
its
self
evident
character
that
no
man
denies
but
that
serpents
are
easily
gendred
of
man
s
flesh
specially
of
his
marrow
lianus
in
like
manner
declares
that
a
dead
man
s
marrow
being
putrified
becomes
a
serpent
florentinus
affirms
that
basil
chewed
and
laid
in
the
sun
will
engender
serpents
another
strange
idea
was
that
serpents
conferred
the
power
of
invisibility

an
antiquary
and
author
and
one
of
the
earliest
fellows
of
the
royal
society
gives
in
full
faith
the
following
recipe
take
on
midsummer
night
at
xii
when
all
the
planets
are
above
the
earth
a
serpent
and
kill
him
and
skinne
him
and
dry
him
in
the
shade
and
bring
it
to
a
powder
hold
it
in
your
hand
and
you
will
be
invisible
his
book
entitled
remaines
of
gentilisme
and
judaisme
is
a
perfect
storehouse
of
old
world
superstitions
an
inexhaustible
mine
of
quaint
imaginings
the
pretious
stone
theory
that
we
have
already
encountered
in
one
or
two
other
cases
the
toad
being
the
most
notable
is
in
full
force
again
amongst
the
various
strange
notions
concerning
serpents
the
recipe
for
its
possession
given
by
jacobus
hollerius
is
simplicity
itself
as
it
is
merely
necessary
that
the
snake
be
tyed
by
the
tayle
with
a
corde
and
hanged
up
and
a
vessell
full
of
water
set
below
after
a
certayne
time
he
will
avoyde
out
of
his
mouth
a
stone
the
stone
is
of
great
medicinal
value
for
instance
it
fullye
and
wholelye
helpes
the
partye
that
hath
the
dropsye
by
merely
being
attached
to
the
body
of
the
sufferer
and
in
divers
other
ways
that
we
need
not
stay
to
particularize
proves
itself
a
stone
of
price
jordanus
amongst
his
other
indian
experiences
came
across
serpents
with
horns
evidently
the
cerastes
or
horned
viper
and
others
with
precious
stones
tennant
tells
us
that
the
cingalese
believe
that
the
stomach
of
the
cobra
contains
a
stone
of
inestimable
value
and
this
belief
absurd
as
we
deem
it
is
really
hardly
more
far
fetched
than
such
a
story
as
pearls
being
found
in
oyster
shells
would
appear
to
a
man
who
heard
it
for
the
first
time
snakes
and
serpents
like
most
other
repulsive
things
have
found
their
way
into
the
pharmacop
ia
and
the
menu
galen
tells
us
that
the
egyptians
used
to
eat
vipers
as
other
people
did
eels
and
it
is
a
very
old
world
superstition
that
viper
s
flesh
is
an
antidote
to
the
viper
s
poison
in
classic
and
medi
val
days
a
famous
remedy
originally
known
as
mithridate
or
theriaca
and
later
on
as
venice
treacle
was
held
to
owe
much
of
its
virtue
as
a
vermifuge
and
antidote
to
all
kinds
of
poison
to
the
vipers
that
formed
one
of
its
ingredients
it
was
retained
in
the
london
pharmacop
ia
until
about
a
hundred
years
ago
its
constituent
parts
changed
somewhat
from
time
to
time
at
one
period
we
see
it
contained
seventy
three
ingredients
the
vipers
were
added
to
the
horrible
mess
by
andromachus
the
physician
to
the
emperor
nero
and
became
a
leading
element
in
the
prescription
the
name
treacle
was
at
one
time
applied
to
any
confection
or
syrup
and
it
is
only
in
these
latter
days
that
the
name
has
become
associated
exclusively
with
the
syrup
of
molasses
it
is
derived
from
the
greek
therion
a
name
given
to
the
viper
so
that
the
schoolboys
lunch
of
bread
and
treacle
is
the
direct
etymological
outcome
of
the
abominable
adder
s
broth
of
the
roman
emperor
one
often
sees
in
these
ancient
remedies
a
foreshadowing
of
the
hom
opathic
notion
of
like
to
like
thus
porta
prescribes
a
present
remedy
for
the
poison
of
the
viper
declaring
that
the
viper
itself
if
you
slay
her
and
strip
off
her
skin
cut
off
her
head
and
tail
cast
away
all
her
entrails
boil
her
like
an
eele
and
give
her
to
one
that
she
hath
bitten
it
will
cure
him
but
in
another
place
he
says
for
serpent
s
bites
i
have
found
nothing
more
excellent
than
the
earth
which
is
brought
from
the
isle
of
malta
for
the
least
dust
of
it
put
into
their
mouths
kills
them
presently
there
is
evidently
here
some
sort
of
connection
endeavoured
to
be
established
between
the
escape
of
st
paul
while
in
malta
from
the
evil
effects
of
the
poison
of
a
viper
and
this
present
prescription
and
it
no
doubt
arose
from
the
old
legend
that
like
st
patrick
in
ireland
st
paul
after
his
experience
of
them
banished
all
snakes
from
the
island
once
granted
that
a
serpent
cannot
live
on
the
soil
of
malta
it
follows
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
that
a
little
of
this
same
soil
administered
to
it
anywhere
the
wide
world
over
will
prove
fatal
to
it
the
recipe
is
nevertheless
a
little
vague
as
it
deals
exclusively
with
the
destruction
of
the
serpent
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
as
the
restoration
to
health
of
the
sufferer
from
its
poison
fangs
prevention
being
better
than
cure
the
hint
that
cogan
gives
in
his
haven
of
health
should
prove
of
value
the
setting
of
lauender
within
the
house
in
floure
pots
must
needes
be
very
wholesome
for
it
driueth
away
venemous
wormes
both
by
strawing
and
by
the
sauour
of
it
and
he
adds
that
being
drunke
in
wine
it
is
a
remedie
against
poyson
tusser
in
his
book
on
husbandry
gives
a
long
list
of
strowing
herbes
their
fragrance
and
remedial
value
being
held
in
high
esteem
by
our
forefathers
no
daintie
flowre
or
herbe
that
growes
on
grownd
no
arborett
with
painted
blossoms
drest
and
smelling
sweete
but
there
it
might
be
fownd
to
bud
out
faire
and
throwe
her
sweet
smels
al
around
the
bunches
of
flowers
that
are
still
presented
to
the
judges
on
the
opening
of
the
law
courts
are
the
graceful
and
now
happily
needless
developments
of
the
bunches
of
herbs
that
were
once
placed
on
their
desks
to
avert
the
dangers
of
the
gaol
fever
that
with
its
noxious
breath
slew
not
the
hapless
prisoners
alone
but
the
judges
on
the
bench
and
administered
wild
justice
on
all
alike
for
the
contempt
of
sanitary
laws
and
for
the
brutality
that
was
rampant
and
supreme
fennel
was
according
to
our
forefathers
held
in
esteem
by
the
serpents
themselves
and
one
scarcely
wonders
that
this
should
be
so
if
it
be
true
that
so
soone
as
they
taste
of
it
they
become
young
again
and
with
the
juice
thereof
repair
their
sight
how
this
juice
is
applied
externally
by
the
serpent
is
not
explained
but
it
very
naturally
suggested
the
idea
to
the
medical
men
of
the
middle
ages
that
what
was
so
good
for
serpents
might
prove
equally
valuable
to
suffering
humanity
hence
to
repair
a
man
s
sight
that
is
dim
nothing
better
than
fennel
could
be
found
though
they
hesitated
to
promise
also
to
the
human
subject
rejuvenescence
the
syrians
according
to
one
venerable
authority
had
a
most
singular
defence
for
their
country
the
land
being
full
of
snakes
that
would
do
no
harm
to
the
natives
even
if
they
trod
upon
them
but
which
eagerly
assailed
the
people
of
any
other
nation
and
destroyed
them
naturally
therefore
the
syrians
cherished
such
a
valuable
protection
though
such
a
state
of
things
would
hardly
accord
with
modern
notions
of
free
trade
and
the
intercourse
of
nations
the
discovery
of
one
wonder
frequently
leads
to
knowledge
of
others
and
aristotle
has
a
companion
story
in
his
history
of
animals
of
scorpions
that
in
caria
sting
to
death
the
natives
of
the
country
but
do
no
harm
to
strangers
in
like
manner
according
to
maundevile
in
the
island
called
silha
wherever
that
may
be
the
men
of
that
yle
seen
comonely
that
the
serpentes
and
the
wilde
bestes
of
that
countree
nee
will
not
don
non
harm
ne
touchen
with
evylle
no
strange
man
that
entreth
into
that
contree
but
only
to
men
that
ben
born
of
the
same
countree
this
differential
treatment
seems
distinctly
hard
on
the
aborigines
it
is
observable
quoth
the
author
of
the
miracles
of
art
and
nature
that
in
crete
there
is
bred
no
serpents
or
venomous
beasts
or
worms
ravenous
or
hurtful
creatures
so
their
sheep
graze
very
securely
without
any
shepheard
yet
if
a
woman
happen
to
bite
a
man
anything
hard
he
will
hardly
be
cured
of
it
a
statement
which
brings
forth
the
very
natural
conclusion
that
if
this
be
true
then
the
last
part
of
the
priviledge
foregoing
of
breeding
no
hurtful
creature
must
needs
be
false
amongst
various
familiar
country
beliefs
lasting
even
to
the
present
day
is
the
one
summed
up
in
the
well
known
expression
deaf
as
an
adder
it
has
for
centuries
been
an
accepted
belief
that
the
adder
lays
one
ear
upon
the
ground
and
closes
the
other
with
its
tail
and
it
doubtless
has
its
origin
in
that
passage
in
the
psalms
of
david
where
it
states
that
the
deaf
adder
stoppeth
her
ears
and
will
not
heed
the
voice
of
the
charmer
charm
he
never
so
wisely
and
we
meet
with
this
idea
over
and
over
again
in
our
own
literature
thus
shakespeare
writes
in
king
henry
vi
what
art
thou
like
the
adder
waxen
deaf
be
poisonous
too
and
again
in
his
troilus
and
cressida
we
find
the
passage
pleasure
and
revenge
have
ears
more
deaf
than
adders
in
orlando
furioso
too
we
find
an
interesting
reference
to
the
old
fancy
he
flies
me
now
nor
more
attends
my
pain
than
the
deaf
adder
heeds
the
charmer
s
strain
many
varieties
of
serpents
were
known
to
the
ancients
and
some
of
them
as
the
cerastes
are
quite
recognizable
from
the
descriptions
given
but
of
others
we
have
no
means
of
identification
the
two
headed
amphisb
na
for
example
that
was
credited
with
such
venomous
malignity
that
nothing
but
twice
the
normal
power
of
offence
sufficed
for
its
deadly
attack
the
amphisb
na
was
an
article
of
faith
with
nicander
who
was
the
first
to
introduce
it
to
the
scientific
world
of
his
name
and
it
is
referred
to
by
galen
pliny
lian
and
many
other
ancient
writers
who
gravely
describe
this
especially
objectionable
reptile
a
small
kind
of
serpent
which
moveth
backward
and
forward
and
hath
two
heads
one
at
either
extreme
the
creature
is
now
entirely
lost
to
science
illustration
fig
aldrovandus
in
his
history
of
serpents
gives
an
illustration
of
the
basilisk
a
serpentine
form
but
having
eight
legs
and
on
its
head
a
crown
another
of
his
figures
shows
us
a
serpentine
form
again
this
time
with
two
legs
the
moderation
in
this
direction
being
fully
compensated
by
the
gift
of
seven
heads
of
human
form
while
another
has
the
serpent
like
body
but
to
this
are
added
two
legs
and
feet
like
those
of
a
cock
and
the
creature
has
six
cocks
heads
all
these
creatures
are
put
forth
and
described
in
all
seriousness
so
it
is
evident
that
the
author
must
either
himself
have
been
excessively
credulous
or
that
he
must
have
expected
to
find
his
readers
so
it
is
manifest
that
such
inventions
are
of
the
lamest
possible
type
nothing
could
be
easier
or
more
fatuous
than
to
fill
a
folio
volume
with
serpents
having
three
cats
heads
five
lions
heads
seven
bisons
heads
or
twenty
rats
heads
and
distribute
legs
in
the
same
liberal
and
senseless
manner
his
drawing
fig
of
a
two
headed
lizard
is
the
nearest
approach
we
can
give
our
readers
to
the
amphisb
na
burton
tells
us
that
in
samogitia
a
small
province
in
poland
the
people
nourish
amongst
them
a
kind
of
four
footed
serpents
above
three
handfuls
in
length
which
they
worship
as
their
household
gods
and
if
mischance
do
happen
to
any
of
their
family
it
is
imputed
presently
to
some
want
of
due
observations
of
these
ugly
creatures
some
old
writers
tell
us
of
hairy
serpents
and
depict
a
thing
something
like
the
well
known
larva
of
the
tiger
moth
the
caterpillar
popularly
known
as
the
woolly
bear
and
familiar
enough
to
all
dwellers
in
the
country
the
only
difference
though
that
a
very
serious
one
being
that
the
woolly
bear
is
barely
three
inches
long
while
the
hairy
serpents
are
stretched
to
any
number
of
feet
that
the
credulity
of
the
narrator
will
permit

fig

a
facsimile
from
one
of
the
illustrations
in

and
represents
the
sort
of
thing
that
he
would
have
us
believe
was
to
be
found
in
his
days
in
africa
that
great
home
of
the
weird
and
mysterious
the
perspective
effect
of
the
coils
of
the
upper
creature
as
they
recede
in
the
distance
towards
the
horizon
suggests
a
terrific
length
something
far
exceeding
any
of
the
possibilities
of
the
present
day
but
this
may
be
only
a
slip
of
draughtmanship
or
a
polite
desire
on
the
part
of
the
two
headed
reptile
not
to
crowd
up
its
three
headed
companion
the
asp
from
being
freely
found
in
egypt
and
other
parts
of
north
africa
was
well
known
to
the
naturalists
of
greece
and
rome
and
its
deadly
nature
fully
understood
though
the
facts
are
perhaps
rather
against
them
when
they
assert
that
they
are
such
affectionate
creatures
that
they
are
always
found
in
pairs
and
cannot
live
without
their
mates
we
are
told
that
should
one
of
the
pair
be
killed
this
sweet
connubial
bliss
is
exchanged
for
deadly
ferocity
and
instant
revenge
the
unhappy
man
is
closely
pursued
and
relentlessly
tracked
and
finds
no
safety
amongst
his
fellows
as
the
avenger
knows
him
from
all
others
and
will
not
be
turned
aside
distance
is
no
object
and
difficulties
no
hindrance
and
all
that
the
luckless
individual
can
do
is
to
take
to
his
heels
with
all
celerity
and
at
the
earliest
opportunity
embark
in
a
boat
or
swim
a
river
and
thus
shake
off
his
relentless
pursuer
democritus
tells
us
that
if
we
mingle
the
blood
of
certain
birds
together
a

be
engendered
whoso

burton
the
author
of
the
anatomy
of
melancholy
writes
being
in
the
country
in
the
vacation
time
not
many
years
ago
at
lindley
in
leicestershire
my
father
s
house
i
first
observed
this
amulet
of
a
spider
in
a
nutshell
wrapped
in
silk
so
applied
for
an
ague
by
my
mother
this
methought
was
most
absurd
and
ridiculous
i
could
see
no
warrant
for
it
till
at
length
rambling
amongst
authors
as
i
often
do
i
found
this
very
medicine
in
dioscorides
approved
by
matthiolus
and
i
began
to
have
a
better
opinion
of
it
and
to
give
more
credit
to
amulets

i
saw
it
in
some
parties
answer
to
experience
gerarde
in

historie
of

found
that
such
a
remedy
however
good
in
theory
however
supported
by
ancient
authority
would
not
bear
the
strain
of
actual
use
he
shall
however
speak
for
himself
in
his
own
refreshingly
quaint
way
it
is
needlesse
he
writes
here
to
alledge
those
things
that
are
added
touching
the
little
wormes
or
magots
found
in
the
heades
of
the
teasell
which
are
to
be
hanged
about
the

for
they
are
nothing
else
but
most
vaine
and
trifling
toies
as
my
selfe
haue
proved
a
little
before
hauing
a
most
grieuous
ague
and
of
long
continuance
notwithstanding
physicke
charmes
these
wormes
hanged
about
my

spiders
put
into
a

and
divers
such
foolish
toies
that
i
was
constrained
to
take
by
phantasticke
people

notwithstanding
i
say
my
helpe
came
from
god
himselfe
for
these
medicines
and
all
other
such
things
did
me
no
good
at
all
it
is
passing
strange
that
such
so
called
remedies
so
easily
proved
valueless
should
have
held
their
ground
for
centuries
and
are
doubtless
even
now
in
the
byways
of
our
land
as
firmly
believed
in
as
they
were
nigh
two
thousand
years
ago
when
one
of
our
own
family
was
ailing
a
woman
in
the
little
wiltshire
village
where
we
were
then
staying
strongly
advised
us
to
drop
some
peas
down
the
well
as
an
infallible
means
of
restoration
to
health
bees
were
held
to
be
bred
out
of
putrefying
carcases
an
idea
that
doubtless
arose
in
very
early
times
as
we
find
it
referred
to
by
virgil
and
other
ancient
authors
and
the
biblical
story
of
the
swarm
of
bees
found
by
sampson
in
the
carcase
of
the
lion
that
he
slew
would
be
held
as
confirmation
though
anyone
reading
the
story
carefully
would
see
that
no
such
inference
could
be
drawn
from
it
many
weeks
had
elapsed
between
the
slaying
of
the
lion
and
the
discovery
of
the
honey
ample
time
for
the
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
to
have
cleared
away
the
flesh
and
for
the
heat
of
the
sun
to
have
dried
up
all
putrefaction
and
rendered
the
skeleton
a
sufficiently
cleanly
and
suitable
place
for
the
wild
bees
to
form
their
combs
within
herodotus
tells
us
that
when
the
amathusians
revenged
themselves
on
onesilus
by
whom
they
had
been
besieged
by
cutting
off
his
head
and
hanging
it
over
one
of
their
city
gates
the
skull
presently
alone
remained
and
in
this
hollow
chamber
a
swarm
of
bees
settled
and
filled
it
with
honeycomb
the
fourth
georgic
of
virgil
which
is
devoted
to
the
subject
of
bees
gives
account
of
a
simple
method
whereby
the
race
of
bees
if
diminished
or
lost
might
be
replenished
he
speaks
of
it
as
an
art
practised
in
egypt
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
it
originated
in
accounts
of
bees
swarming
in
the
dead
bodies
of
animals
the
process
was
to
kill
a
young
bullock
by
stopping
up
his
nostrils
so
that
the
skin
should
be
unbroken
by
any
wound
and
then
leaving
it
for
nine
days
in
a
position
where
it
would
be
undisturbed
when
behold
a
prodigy
for
from
within
the
broken
bowels
and
the
bloated
skin
a
buzzing
sound
of
bees
the
ear
alarms
straight
issuing
through
the
sides
assembling
swarms
dark
as
a
cloud
they
make
a
wheeling
flight
then
on
a
neighbouring
tree
descending
light
like
a
large
cluster
of
black
grapes
they
show
and
make
a
large
dependence
from
the
bough
in
this
account
we
see
clearly
enough
that
the
belief
in
the
generation
of
the
bees
from
the
putrefying
body
is
frankly
accepted
the
author
of
the
speculum
mundi
hundreds
of
years
after
the
georgics
were
written
declares
that
a
dead
horse
breeds
wasps
that
from
the
body
of
an
ass
proceed
humble
bees
while
a
mule
produces
hornets
those
who
would
have
bees
must
seek
them
in
a
dead
calf
though
he
adds
the
curious
limitation
if
the
west
winde
blow
he
goes
on
to
say
whether
the
bees
in
samson
s
dead
lion
were
bred
anywhere
else
no
man
knoweth
as
an
englishman
more
familiar
with
the
possibilities
of
a
dead
calf
than
with
those
of
a
dead
lion
he
declines
to
commit
himself
to
an
opinion
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
possible
in
far
distant
lands
over
sea
the
strange
association
of
ideas
that
we
have
seen
in
many
other
instances
may
be
well
seen
again
in
the
notion
that
if
one
pounds
up
those
luminous
creatures
of
the
night
glowworms
the
result
will
be
an
ink
that
will
render
any
writing
performed
by
its
aid
visible
in
the
dark
winstanley
in
his
pathway
to
knowledge
gives
a
simple
receipt
for
the
manufacture
of
this
useful
ink
and
other
writers
are
content
to
copy
him
or
each
other
in
the
laudable
desire
to
spread
abroad
the
knowledge
of
this
luminous
fluid
one
can
easily
realize
that
such
a
preparation
might
at
times
be
really
very
useful
turning
in
conclusion
our
attention
to
the
creatures
of
sea
and
stream
we
at
once
encounter
the
favourite
medi
val
theory
that
all
creatures
of
the
land
had
their
marine
counterparts
there
is
nothing
says
the
comparatively
modern
writer
camden
bred
in
any
part
of
nature
but
the
same
is
in
the
sea
while
olaus
magnus
affirms
that
there
be
fishes
like
to
dogs
cows
calves
horses
eagles
dragons
and
what
not
these
mysterious
denizens
of
the
deep
were
an
unfailing
resource
in
the
romances
and
poems
of
the
middle
ages
and
an
article
of
faith
with
the
writers
on
natural
history
on
the
assyrian
slabs
we
see
the
monster
upward
man
and
downward
fish
while
the
mermaid
we
all
recognize
as
a
most
familiar
instance
of
the
presence
of
creatures
at
least
semi
human
in
the
broad
and
mysterious
expanse
of
ocean
b
wulf
the
saxon
poet
writes
of
the
sea
wolf
of
the
abyss
the
mighty
sea
woman
the
quotation
is
not
altogether
complimentary
in
its
sentiment
no
lady
of
one
s
acquaintance
would
feel
flattered
on
being
addressed
as
a
sea
wolf
but
while
a
certain
halo
of
romance
has
in
these
later
days
gathered
round
the
idea
of
the
mermaid
those
who
really
believed
in
her
gave
her
credit
for
deeds
considerably
more
heinous
than
combing
her
flowing
hair
in
the
sunlight
since
her
beauty
was
a
snare
and
destruction
to
all
who
came
within
its
fatal
influence
sir
thomas
browne
in
his
merciless
dissection
of
the
vulgar
beliefs
of
his
day
writes
with
his
accustomed
quaintness
and
equally
accustomed
sound
common
sense
that
all
animals
of
the
land
are
in
their
kinde
in
the
sea
although
received
as
a
principle
is
a
tenet
very
questionable
and
that
will
admit
of
restraint
for
some
in
the
sea
are
not
to
be
matcht
by
any
enquiry
at
land
and
hold
those
shapes
which
terrestrious
formes
approach
not
as
may
be
observed
in
the
moonfish
and
the
severall
sorts
of
raias
torpedos
oysters
and
many
more
and
some
there
are
in
the
land
which
were
never
mentioned
to
be
in
sea
as
panthers
hy
nas
cammells
molls
and
others
which
carry
no
name
in
ichthology
nor
are
to
be
found
in
the
exact
descriptions
of
rondoletius
gesner
and
aldrovandus
again
though
many
there
be
which
make
out
their
nominations
as
the
sea
serpents
and
others
yet
there
are
also
very
many
that
bear
the
names
of
animalls
at
land
which
hold
no
resemblance
in
corporall
configuration
wherein
while
some
are
called
the
fox
the
dog
or
frog
fish
and
are
known
by
common
names
with
those
at
land
as
their
describers
attest
they
receive
not
these
appellations
from
a
totall
similitude
in
figure
but
any
concurrence
in
common
accidents
in
colour
condition
or
single
conformation
as
for
sea
horses
which
much
confirm
this
assertion
in
their
common
descriptions
they
are
but
grotesco
delineations
which
fill
up
empty
spaces
in
maps
and
meer
pictoriall
inventions
not
any
physicall
shapes
that
which
the
ancients
named
hippocampus
is
a
little
animall
about
six
inches
long
and
not
preferred
beyond
the
classis
of
insects
that
they
termed
hippopotamus
an
amphibious
animall
about
the
river
nile
so
little
resembleth
an
horse
that
except
the
feet
it
better
makes
out
a
swine
although
it
be
not
denied
that
some
in
the
water
doe
carry
a
justifiable
resemblance
to
some
at
land
yet
are
the
major
part
which
bear
their
names
unlike
nor
doe
they
otherwise
resemble
the
creatures
on
earth
than
they
on
earth
the
constellations
which
passe
under
animall
names
in
heaven
nor
the
dogfish
at
sea
much
more
make
out
the
dog
of
the
land
than
that
his
cognominall
or
namesake
in
the
heavens
he
then
goes
on
to
show
that
this
belief
restrains
omnipotence
and
abridges
the
variety
of
creation
making
the
creatures
of
one
element
but
a
counterpart
of
the
other
illustration
fig
this
belief
in
sea
monsters
of
all
kinds
was
naturally
not
a
chance
that
a
man
like
aldrovandus
could
miss
he
gives
his
imagination
full
scope
or
perhaps
we
should
rather
say
his
credulity
as
he
introduces
these
creatures
to
us
as
things
as
real
as
a
rabbit
his
sea
monk
for
instance
with
tonsured
human
head
arms
replaced
by
fins
and
legs
by
fishy
tail
being
as
matter
of
fact
as
one
s
vicar
fig
is
given
by
him
in
all
good
faith
as
the
true
presentment
of
a
sea
bishop
though
not
at
all
our
notion
of
a
bishop
in
his
see
the
right
hand
it
will
be
seen
is
giving
the
benediction
the
dragon
of
the
deep
shown
in
fig
aims
at
being
terrible
but
merely
succeeds
in
being
feeble
we
cannot
but
feel
that
the
draughtsman
here
failed
to
reach
our
ideal
for
one
has
certainly
seen
many
representations
of
land
dragons
far
more
fear
inspiring
than
this
bloated
monster
with
ears
like
a
king
charles
spaniel
and
tail
like
a
rat
this
illustration
is
from
another
source
the
work
of
ambrosinus
on
the
same
subject
published
permissu
superiorum
in
the
year
while
the
book
is
as
quaint
and
grotesque
as
any
of
its
rivals
the
skill
of
the
artist
has
in
divers
cases
not
paralleled
the
gifts
of
description
of
the
author
illustration
fig
the
monstrosus
sus
marinus
or
terrible
sow
of
the
sea
or
more
especially
perhaps
of
aldrovandus

will
surely
fully
come
up
to
everyone
s
expectation
of
what
a
marine
pig
should
be
like
catching
a
weasel
asleep
should
be
a
comparatively
easy
task
to
circumventing
sus
marinus
it
seems
such
a
peculiarly
wide
awake
animal
possibly
in
the
struggle
for
existence
in
the
watery
depths
its
toothsome
flesh
may
place
it
in
jeopardy
and
nature
may
have
bestowed
upon
it
these
numerous
eyes
to
enable
it
to
evade
dragons
and
other
foes
having
a
penchant
for
pork
a
rather
unexpected
addition
to
the
various
better
known
examples
of
that
comfortable
doctrine
for
the
well
to
do
the
survival
of
the
fittest
purchas
tells
us
of
a
fish
called
the
angulo
or
hog

hath

says
as
it
were
two
hands
and
a
tail
like
a

whereof
they
make
lard

it
hath
not
the
savour

grasse
that
groweth
on
the
banks
of

never
goeth

us

another
of
the
strange
creatures
of
ocean

shown
in
fig
it
is
somewhat
startling
to
reflect
that
our
ancestors
had
at
least
the
expectation
that
such
a
monster
might
at
any
moment
rise
alongside
their
vessel
and
address
them
in
the
peremptory
tones
that
the
figure
suggests
and
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
illustrations
are
not
a
tithe
of
the
strange
imaginings
that
even
this
one
old
book
sets
forth
though
it
is
needless
to
multiply
examples
from
it
we
have
carefully
drawn
our
figures
in
facsimile
from
the
originals
and
have
naught
extenuated
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
they
are
fairly
typical
examples
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
encountered
on
page
after
page
illustration
fig
in
the
excellent
book
of
rondeletius
doctoris
medici
et
medicin
in
schola
monspeliensi
professoris
regii
published
in
the
year
on
the
subject
of
marine
fishes
the
illustrations
are
full
of
spirit
and
life
amongst
these
fish
of
the
ocean
we
find
the
sea
bishop
sea
monk
c
all
over
again
and
such
creatures
as
the
sea
lion
fig
this
latter
except
for
his
scaly
hide
has
nothing
very
suggestively
aquatic
about
him
the
book
in
addition
to
such
impossibilities
contains
very
good
and
life
like
representations
of
the
sun
fish
sturgeon
hammer
headed
shark
ray
and
many
others
the
author
of
the
speculum
mundi
confirms
all
these
wonders
and
adds
his
quota
to
the
general
store
he
affirms
that
in
the
year
there
was
taken
in
norway
neare
to
a
seaport
called
elpoch
a
certain
fish
resembling
a
mitred
bishop
who
was
kept
alive
six
days
after
his
taking
and
there
was
as
the
author
of
du
bartas
his
summarie
reporteth
one
ferdinand
alvares
secretarie
to
the
storehouse
of
the
indians
who
faithfully
witnesseth
that
he
had
seene
not
farre
off
from
the
promontorie
of
the
moon
a
young
sea
man
coming
out
of
the
waters
who
stole
fishes
from
the
fishermen
and
ate
them
raw
neither
is
olaus
magnus
silent
on
these
things
for
he
also
saith
there
be
monsters
in
the
sea
as
it
were
imitating
the
shape
of
a
man
having
a
dolefull
kinde
of
sounde
or
singing
there
be
also
sea
men
of
an
absolute
proportion
in
their
whole
body
these
are
sometimes
seene
to
climbe
up
the
ships
in
the
night
times
and
suddenly
to
depresse
that
part
upon
which
they
sit
and
if
they
abide
long
the
whole
ship
sinketh
yea
saithe
he
this
i
adde
from
the
faithfull
assertions
of
the
norway
fishers
that
when
such
are
taken
if
they
be
not
presently
let
go
again
there
ariseth
such
a
fierce
tempest
with
an
horrid
noise
of
those
kinde
of
creatures
and
other
sea
monsters
there
assembled
that
a
man
would
think
the
verie
heaven
were
falling
and
the
vaulted
roofe
of
the
world
running
to
ruine
insomuch
that
the
fishermen
have
much
ado
to
escape
with
their
lives
whereupon
they
confirmed
it
as
a
law
amongst
them
that
if
any
chanced
to
hang
such
a
fish
upon
his
hook
he
should
suddenly
cut
the
line
and
let
him
go
on
but
these
sudden
tempests
are
very
strange
and
how
they
arise
with
such
violent
speed
exceeds
the
bounds
of
ordinary
admiration
whereupon
it
is
again
supposed
that
these
monsters
are
verie
devils
and
by
their
power
such
strange
storms
are
raised
howbeit
for
my
part
i
think
otherwise
and
do
much
rather
affirm
that
these
storms
in
my
judgment
are
thus
raised
namely
by
the
thickening
and
breaking
of
the
aire
which
the
snortling
rushing
and
howling
of
these
beasts
assembled
in
an
innumerable
companie
causeth
for
it
is
certain
that
sounds
will
break
and
alter
the
aire
as
i
have
heard
it
of
a
citie
freed
from
the
plague
by
the
thundering
noise
of
cannons
and
also
i
suppose
that
the
violent
rushing
of
these
beasts
causeth
much
water
to
flie
up
and
thicken
the
aire
and
by
their
howling
and
snortling
under
the
waters
they
do
blow
up
and
as
it
were
attenuate
the
waves
and
make
them
arise
in
a
thinner
substance
than
at
other
times
so
that
nature
having
all
these
helps
in
an
instant
worketh
to
the
amazement
of
the
mariners
and
often
to
the
danger
of
their
lives
besides
shall
we
think
that
spirits
use
to
feed
and
will
be
so
foolish
as
to
go
and
hang
themselves
on
an
hook
for
a
bait
they
may
have
occult
properties
as
the
loadstone
hath
to
work
strange
feats
and
yet
be
neither
spirits
nor
devils
for
experience
likewise
teacheth
that
they
die
sooner
or
later
after
their
taking
neither
can
a
spirit
have
flesh
and
bones
as
they
have
illustration
fig
the
monsters
of
the
deep
are
best
seen
at
the
times
of
the
equinox
for
then
says
pliny
by
the
whirlwinds
rains
and
tempests
which
rush
with
violence
from
the
rugged
mountains
the
seas
are
turned
up
from
the
very
bottom
and
thus
the
billows
roll
and
raise
these
beasts
out
of
the
deep
parts
of
the
ocean
it
certainly
seems
a
much
more
reasonable
theory
that
the
storms
produce
the
beasts
than
that
the
beasts
produce
the
storms
illustration
fig
on
an
antique
seal
we
remember
to
have
seen
a
sea
elephant
a
creature
having
the
forelegs
tusks
trunk
and
great
flapping
ears
of
the
african
elephant
yet
terminating
in
the
body
of
a
fish
and
duly
furnished
with
piscine
tail
and
fins
this
outrageous
combination
would
seem
to
indicate
the
limit
possible
to
absurdity
in
this
direction
when
the
ancient
writers
would
desire
to
people
the
vast
unknown
of
air
and
sea
their
thoughts
naturally
turned
to
those
creatures
of
the
land
with
which
they
were
more
familiar
hence
the
denizens
of
the
air
or
ocean
are
not
really
creations
at
all
but
adaptations
wings
or
fins
being
added
to
horses
lions
and
the
like
according
to
the
new
element
in
which
they
were
to
figure
of
these
the
sea
horses
that
drew
the
chariot
of
neptune
through
the
waves
or
the
winged
steed
pegasus
are
examples
that
at
once
occur
to
one
s
mind
the
sea
horse
according
to
some
authorities
is
found
floating
on
the
ice
between
britain
and
norway
and
is
taken
by
the
whalers
for
the
oil
he
contains
he
is
described
as
having
a
head
like
a
horse
and
as
sometimes
neighing
but
his
hoofs
are
said
to
be
cloven
like
those
of
a
cow
while
his
hinder
parts
are
those
of
a
fish
this
creature
would
appear
to
be
now
quite
lost
to
science
the
sea
horse
naturally
suggests
the
idea
of
the
sea
unicorn
depicted
as
of
equine
form
but
having
the
hinder
parts
piscine
in
character
the
horn
of
the
sea
unicorn
occasionally
brought
home
by
merchants
and
mariners
was
probably
the
sword
of
the
swordfish
or
the
tusk
of
the
narwhal
as
it
is
often
mentioned
that
it
was
able
to
penetrate
the
ribs
of
ships
and
later
experience
has
proved
that
an
encounter
between
swordfish
or
narwhal
and
ships
has
occasionally
taken
place
the
tusk
of
the
narwhal
is
a
spiral
tapering
rod
of
ivory
sometimes
attaining
to
the
length
of
eight
or
ten
feet
purchas
mentions
a
horn
of
a
sea
unicorn
that
was
presented
by
frobisher
to
his
sovereign
and
preserved
at
windsor
and
the
name
of
this
great
arctic
voyager
naturally
suggests
that
this
horn
was
the
tusk
of
a
narwhal
a
creature
of
the
northern
seas
one
old
writer
speaks
of
the
horn
as
a
wreathy
spire
a
description
which
admirably
accords
with
the
narwhal
tusk
the
fact
once
established
that
there
were
creatures
in
the
sea
with
horns
like
unicorns
it
was
at
once
assumed
that
they
had
the
horse
like
form
assigned
to
the
land
unicorn
and
in
some
of
the
old
authors
the
sea
unicorn
is
represented
as
of
purely
equine
form
plus
the
horn
in
a
book
published
in
entitled
a
helpe
to
memorie
and
discourse
we
find
this
question
asked
whether
doth
a
dead
body
in
a
shippe
cause
the
shippe
to
sail
slower
and
if
it
doe
what
is
thought
to
be
the
reason
thereof
the
answer
to
the
query
is
that
the
shippe
is
as
insensible
of
the
living
as
the
dead
and
as
the
living
make
it
goe
the
faster
so
the
dead
make
it
not
goe
the
slower
for
the
dead
are
no
rhemoras
to
alter
the
course
of
her
passage
though
some
there
be
that
thinke
so
and
that
by
a
kind
of
mournful
sympathy
the
potent
influence
of
the
remora
or
sucking
fish
to
arrest
the
progress
of
a
ship
by
merely
adhering
to
its
keel
is
a
curious
fancy
that
has
been
handed
on
for
centuries
pliny
and
many
other
ancient
writers
had
full
belief
in
this
foe
to
the
mariner
and
references
to
it
in
much
more
recent
authors
are
by
no
means
uncommon
thus
ben
jonson
alludes
to
it
in
the
lines
i
say
a
remora
for
it
will
stay
a
ship
that
s
under
sail
while
spenser
in
his
visions
of
the
world
s
vanity
writes
looking
far
forth
into
the
ocean
wide
a
goodly
ship
with
banners
bravely
dight
and
flag
in
her
top
gallant
i
espied
through
the
main
sea
making
her
merry
flight
fair
blew
the
wind
into
her
bosom
right
and
th
heavens
looked
lovely
all
the
while
that
she
did
seem
to
dance
as
in
delight
and
at
her
own
felicity
did
smile
all
suddenly
there
clove
unto
her
keel
a
little
fish
that
we
call
remora
which
stopt
her
course
and
held
her
by
the
heel
that
wind
nor
tide
could
move
her
thence
away
we
may
indeed
be
thankful
that
this
mysterious
power
worse
even
than
the
more
prosaic
barnacles
and
other
sea
impedimenta
that
plague
the
modern
shipowner
by
fouling
the
bottom
of
his
good
ship
and
so
retarding
her
course
seems
to
be
no
longer
exercised
the
merchantman
speeding
home
with
perishable
cargo
the
yachtsman
burning
to
carry
off
the
challenge
cup
the
great
record
breaking
atlantic
liner
carrying
under
heavy
penalty
for

her
majesty
s

would
all
be
terribly
hampered
in
their
several
ambitions
in
presence
of
so
potent
yet
so
apparently
insignificant
a
foe
well
might
spenser
add
strange
thing
meseemeth
that
so
small
a
thing
should
able
be
so
great
an
one
to
wring
one
old
writer
feeling
the
impossibility
of
giving
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
marvel
is
content
to
say
of
which
there
can
be
no
more
reason
given
than
of
the
loadstone
drawing
iron
neither
is
it
possible
to
shew
the
cause
of
all
secrets
in
nature
a
statement
as
true
to
day
as
the
day
it
was
written
though
this
particular
secret
of
nature
has
in
the
interval
been
disestablished
that
the
dolphin
was
the
swiftest
of
all
living
creatures
more
rapid
than
a
bird
swifter
than
an
arrow
shot
from
a
bow
will
probably
be
an
entirely
new
idea
to
most
of
our
readers
yet
such
was
the
ancient
belief
the
dolphin
occurs
very
freely
in
blazonry
on
ancient
coinage
and
in
classic
and
renaissance
decoration
and
it
is
almost
always
represented
either
as
embowed
that
is
to
say
bent
round
like
a
bow
such
being
the
significance
of
the
heraldic
term
or
else
it
is
introduced
with
its
lithe
body
coiled
gracefully
round
an
anchor
or
trident
in
either
case
the
representation
suggests
an
easy
going
and
leisurely
state
of
affairs
that
is
very
different
to
the
picture
conjured
up
by
the
arrowy
rush
of
the
creature
through
the
waves
as
pliny
paints
it
for
us
it
is
a
very
old
belief
that
the
dolphin
has
an
especial
fondness
for
man
of
a
man
he
is
nothing
afraid
neither
avoideth
from
him
as
a
stranger
but
of
himselfe
meeteth
their
ships
plaieth
and
disporteth
himselfe
and
fetcheth
a
thousand
friskes
and
gambols
before
them
he
will
swimme
along
by
the
mariners
as
it
were
for
a
wager
who
should
make
way
most
speedily
and
alwaies
outgoeth
them
saile
they
with
never
so
good
a
forewind
the
representation
of
the
dolphin
with
the
anchor
is
not
simply
a
type
of
maritime
supremacy
but
is
a
distinct
illustration
of
this
belief
in
the
dolphin
s
kindly
regard
for
man
thus
camerarius
asserts
that
when
tempests
arise
and
sea
men
cast
their
anchor
the
dolphin
from
its
love
to
man
twines
itself
round
it
and
directs
it
so
that
it
may
more
safely
lay
hold
of
the
ground
the
works
of
the
ancient
writers
abound
with
illustrations
of
the
friendly
regard
of
the
dolphin
for
mankind
thus
in
one
wonderful
story
we
have
a
schoolboy
the
son
of
a
poor
man
who
had
to
travel
each
day
from
baianum
to
puteoli
who
used
at
the
water
s
edge
to
call
a
dolphin
to
his
aid
the
dolphin
would
at
once
respond
to
the
call
and
the
boy
used
to
mount
upon
his
back
and
be
taken
across
the
sea
and
be
brought
back
again
at
night
this
went
on
for
some
years
and
at
last
when
the
boy
fell
sick
and
died
his
constitution
probably
not
being
able
to
stand
the
constant
wetting
and
exposure
the
dolphin
was
inconsolable
and
promptly
died
of
a
broken
heart
in
another
story
equally
veracious
the
rider
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
pierce
himself
with
one
of
the
sharp
spines
of
the
dorsal
fin
and
an
artery
being
severed
he
bled
to
death
the
dolphin
seeing
the
water
stained
with
blood
and
finding
that
his
rider
did
not
sit
on
his
back
in
the
light
and
active
way
that
had
been
his
wont
concluded
that
some
catastrophe
had
happened
and
when
he
realized
the
full
truth
resolved
not
to
outlive
him
whom
he
had
affectionately
loved
and
therefore
ran
himself
with
all
his
might
upon
the
shore
and
so
perished
pliny
mec
nas
fabianus
flavius
alfius
lian
aulus
gellius
apion
egesidemus
theophrastus
and
many
other
old
writers
all
give
equally
surprising
illustrations
of
this
wonderful
love
of
the
dolphin
for
mankind
the
dolphin
is
also
a
great
lover
of
music
and
equally
wonderful
stories
are
told
in
illustration
of
this
taste
also
another
well
known
belief
in
connection
with
it
is
the
imaginary
brilliancy
of
its
changeful
colours
when
dying
the
idea
has
been
a
favourite
one
with
poets
in
all
ages
an
example
from
byron
s
childe
harold
s
pilgrimage
will
suffice
as
an
illustration
parting
day
dies
like
the
dolphin
whom
each
pang
imbues
with
a
new
colour
as
it
gasps
away
the
last
still
loveliest
till
tis
gone
and
all
is
gray
another
strange
fish
believed
in
by
our
forefathers
was
the
acipenser
a
fish
of
an
unnatural
making
and
quality
as
an
old
writer
terms
him
and
indeed
he
may
very
well
do
so
as
we
are
told
that
his
scales
are
all
turned
towards
his
head
we
are
not
therefore
much
surprised
to
learn
that
he
ever
swimmeth
against
the
stream
though
we
might
well
be
more
astonished
if
we
ever
found
him
swimming
at
all
the
amiable
dolphin
stands
not
alone
in
its
friendship
with
man
the
ray
too
if
we
may
believe
a
medi
val
authority
is
a
loving
fish
to
man
for
swimming
in
the
waters
and
being
greedily
pursued
by
the
devouring
sea
dogs
the
ray
defends
him
and
will
not
leave
him
untill
he
be
out
of
danger
sometimes
the
friendship
is
with
some
other
creature
thus
porta
gives
an
unfailing
recipe
for
catching
a
sargon
whatever
that
may
be
by
taking
advantage
of
this
kindly
trait
in
its
character
the
sargi
he
declares
love
goats
unmeasurably
and
they
are
so
mad
after
them
that
when
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
goat
that
feeds
neer
the
shore
shall
appear
neer
unto
them
they
presently
leap
for
joy
and
swim
to
it
in
haste
and
they
imitate
the
goats
though
they
are
not
fit
to
leap
and
thus
they
delight
to
come
unto
them
they
are
therefore
catcht
by
those
things
that
they
so
much
desire
whereupon
the
fisher
putting
on
a
goat
s
skin
with
the
horns
lies
in
wait
for
them
having
the
sunne
behind
his
back
and
paste
made
wet
with
the
decoction
of
goat
s
flesh
this
he
casts
into
the
sea
where
the
sargi
are
to
come
and
they
as
if
they
were
charmed
run
to
it
and
are
much
delighted
with
the
sight
of
the
goat
s
skin
and
feed
on
the
paste
thus
the
fishermen
catcheth
abundance
of
them
porta
gives
no
suggestion
that
this
affection
is
reciprocal
another
medi
val
writer
has
a
still
more
extraordinary
story
of
the
kind
and
in
this
case
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
the
loving
feeling
is
mutual
amongst
the
severall
sort
of
shell
fishes
saith
he
the
glistering
pearl
fish
deserves
remembrance
not
only
in
respect
of
herself
but
also
in
regard
of
the
prawn
another
fish
and
her
companion
for
between
these
two
there
is
a
most
firm
league
of
friendship
much
kindnesse
and
such
familiaritie
as
cannot
but
breed
admiration
in
the
reader
they
have
a
subtill
kinde
of
hunting
which
being
ended
they
divide
their
prey
in
loving
manner
for
seeing
they
one
help
the
other
in
the
getting
of
it
they
likewise
joyn
in
the
equall
sharing
and
in
few
words
thus
it
is
when
the
pearl
fish
gapeth
wide
she
hath
a
curious
glistering
within
her
shell
by
which
she
allureth
her
small
fry
to
come
swimming
unto
her
which
when
her
companion
the
prawn
perceiveth
he
gives
her
a
secret
touch
with
one
of
his
prickles
wherupon
she
shuts
her
gaping
shell
and
so
incloseth
her
wished
prey
then
as
i
said
they
equally
share
them
out
and
feed
themselves
and
thus
day
by
day
they
get
their
livings
like
a
combined
knot
of
cheaters
who
have
no
other
trade
than
the
cunning
deceit
of
quaint
consenage
hooking
in
the
simpler
sort
with
such
subtill
tricks
that
be
their
purses
stuft
with
either
more
or
less
they
know
a
way
to
sound
the
bottome
and
send
them
lighter
home
lighter
in
purse
though
heavier
in
heart
the
moral
seems
perhaps
needlessly
severe
and
we
trust
that
henceforth
our
readers
after
reading
this
romance
of
the
deep
will
have
a
kindlier
feeling
for
these
faithful
friends
the
artful
oyster
and
the
watchful
prawn
the
only
drawback
to
the
sentiment
of
the
thing
seems
to
be
that
this
loving
alliance
has
a
somewhat
low
motive
as
its
basis
one
at
least
of
the
partners
is
capable
of
a
more
tender
passion
as
we
have
the
authority
of
sheridan
for
saying
that
an
oyster
may
be
crossed
in
love
olaus
magnus
gives
an
awful
example
of
voracity
in
the
swam
fish
one
of
the
most
greedy
cravens
of
the
denizens
of
the
sea
and
cites
many
stories
of
it
that
amply
justify
the
bad
character
bestowed
on
it
another
old
writer
affirms
that
when
danger
threatens
he
will
so
winde
up
himselfe
and
cover
his
head
with
the
skinne
and
substance
of
his
own
body
that
he
is
then
bent
like
unto
a
piece
of
dead
fish
and
nothing
like
himself
the
plan
however
appears
to
have
its
drawbacks
as
the
venerable
and
veracious
author
goes
on
to
say
that
this
feat
he
seldome
doth
without
hurt
or
damage
for
still
fearing
that
there
be
those
about
him
who
will
prey
upon
him
and
devoure
him
he
is
compelled
for
lack
of
meat
to
feed
upon
the
substance
of
his
own
body
choosing
rather
to
be
devoured
in
part
than
to
be
consumed
by
other
more
strong
and
powerful
fishes
at
best
a
most
painful
alternative
in
the
account
of
the
creation
the
forming
of
the
whale
is
specially
dwelt
upon
and
god
created
great
whales
and
every
living
creature
that
moveth
which
the
waters
brought
forth
abundantly
after
their
kind
luther
commenting
on
this
says
that
the
creation
of
whales
is
specified
by
name
lest
affrighted
with
their
greatness
we
should
believe
them
to
be
only
visions
or
fancies
though
later
commentators
have
decided
that
the
leviathan
of
the
bible
is
the
crocodile
it
was
long
held
to
be
the
whale
milton
in
the
first
book
of
the
paradise
lost
writes
of
that
sea
beast
leviathan
which
god
of
all
his
works
created
hugest
that
swim
the
ocean
stream
and
the
jews
had
a
legend
that
the
first
whales
were
so
immense
in
bulk
so
formidable
in
attack
so
voracious
that
there
was
considerable
risk
of
their
overtoppling
the
rest
of
creation
so
while
as
yet
there
were
but
two
of
them
in
existence
one
was
destroyed
in
order
that
the
race
might
not
be
continued
and
the
general
balance
of
nature
upset
our
ancestors
found
apt
moral
against
the
scornful
in
the
reason
assigned
for
the
mouth
of
the
flounder
being
on
one
side
it
appears
that
at
one
time
the
flounder
s
mouth
was
as
fair
to
see
as
any
other
but
that
it
lost
all
its
beauty
through
contemptuous
flouting
of
the
herring
and
it
has
borne
this
evil
mark
of
its
jealousy
ever
since
and
will
probably
so
bear
it
to
the
end
of
time
at
the
vague
date
known
as
once
upon
a
time
we
are
told
that
all
the
fishes
of
the
sea
assembled
to
choose
a
king
and
that
the
herring
was
elected
to
this
dignified
position
the
flounder
on
account
of
his
red
spots
and
other
features
that
were
evidently
more
appreciated
by
himself
than
by
the
main
body
of
electors
had
strong
hope
that
he
should
himself
be
chosen
and
the
unlovely
grimace
with
which
he
saluted
his
sovereign
was
as
a
judgment
upon
him
made
a
fixture
for
all
time
as
a
punishment
to
himself
and
a
warning
to
others
the
tench
was
commonly
called
the
physician
for
it
was
believed
by
our
forefathers
that
when
the
other
fish
were
in
any
way
hurt
and
required
the
aid
of
surgeon
or
physician
they
healed
themselves
by
rubbing
against
the
tench
finding
the
slime
of
his
body
to
be
a
soveraigne
salve
for
their
needs
for
the
sufferings
of
humanity
the
beasts
birds
and
plants
appear
to
have
supplied
a
sufficient
materia
medica
and
the
less
accessible
creatures
of
the
waters
were
but
rarely
pressed
into
the
medi
val
pharmacop
ia
the
blood
of
the
eel
was
rubbed
upon
unwelcome
warts
and
a
cruel
remedy
for
bad
eyes
the
cruelty
being
as
we
have
seen
over
and
over
again
in
those
old
remedies
by
no
means
an
exceptional
feature
was
to
capture
a
crab
alive
cut
out
its
eyes
and
then
let
it
go
the
eyes
were
then
bound
upon
the
neck
of
the
man
woman
or
child
and
a
satisfactory
result
was
speedily
anticipated
though
very
possibly
not
so
speedily
forthcoming
the
cuttle
fish
is
scarcely
one
s
ideal
of
beauty
yet
it
is
by
its
vanity
and
belief
in
its
personal
attractions
that
it
is
most
readily
captured
porta
tells
us
that
pieces
of
looking
glass
are
let
down
by
the
fishermen
into
the
waters
and
that
the
cuttle
seeing
his
image
reflected
clasps
the
glass
around
and
while
he
is
still
enamoured
with
the
reflection
of
his
charms
is
drawn
to
the
surface
by
the
wily
fishermen
in
the
pathway
to
knowledge
published
in
the
year
we
are
told
that
if
we
take
the
juice
of
nettles
and
houseleek
and
anoint
our
hands
therewith
the
fish
will
gather
round
and
you
may
take
them
out
at
your
pleasure
this
seems
almost
as
simple
a
method
as
the
catching
of
birds
by
placing
a
pinch
of
salt
on
their
tails
if
we
may
credit
maundevile
and
the
if
is
a
most
important
point
in
one
favoured
land
instead
of
the
people
going
for
the
fish
the
fish

to
the
people
in
a
certain
isle
or
we
may
perhaps
more
truthfully
say
an
uncertain
isle
called
calonak
many
wonderful
things
were
to
be
seen
but
one
of
these
he
especially
and
very
justly
calls
a
gret
marvayle
and
when
he
goes
on
to
add
that
it
is
more
to
speke
of
than
in
ony
partie
of
the
world
one
is
loath
to
gainsay

and
though

duly
set

at

by

other

conclude
that
a

come

of
their
increase
the

that
swim
in
the
boiling

of
some
tropical
stream
that

now
unknown
all
sink
as

into

the
whole

has
now
been
so
ransacked
that
there
is
little
room
in
these

for
the
imagination
to
play
but
in

travellers
brought
back
such
wonderful

some
of

true
and
others
perhaps
a
little
wanting
in

respect
of

that
they
had

that
almost
anything
seemed
a
possibility
of
this
our

may
be
considered
some
little

it

be

that

the
title
pages
of
these
old
books
should
by
no
means
be
overlooked
as
they
are
often
full
of
interest
and
meaning
in
the
one
before
us
we
have
at
the

the
hebrew
name
for
jehovah
within
an
equilateral

on

from

issues
a
narrow
track
that
broadens
as
it
goes
and
finally
returns
to
the

its

of

being
marked

we
find
philosophia
with

the
titles
of
many
of
these
old
books
are
sufficiently
quaint
and
striking
sometimes
a

is
called
a

with
the
most
startling
directness
while
at
others
the

is
a
mystical

the

of
the

necessary
to
exterpate

and
to

there
would
appear
to
be
here

little
confusion
of

the

so
on

to
whom
the

i
conceive
it
he
says
to
be
courteous
and
to
indicate
an
ingenious
modesty
to
acknowledge
the
source
whence
we
have
derived
assistance
and
not
act
as
most
of
those
have
done
whom
i
have
examined
for
i
must
inform
you
that
in
consulting
various
authors
i
have
discovered
that
some
of
the
most
grave
and
of
the
latest
writers
have
transcribed
word
for
word
from
former
works
without
making
any
acknowledgment
he
only
used
one
pen
throughout
a
circumstance
which
he
deemed
sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
celebrated
in
these
lines
which
are
prefixed
to
his
book
with
one
sole

i
wrote

variety
of

and
be
a
source
of
happiness
and
cheerfulness
to
me
during

and
a
shield
against
its
ills
however
things
might
go
amiss
and
the

frown
upon
me
it
would
be
a
taste
for

give
a
man
this
taste
and
the
means
of
gratifying
it
and
you
can
hardly
fail
of
making
him
a
happy
man
unless
indeed
you
put
into
his
hands
a
most
perverse
selection
of

you
place
him
in

of

with
the
wisest
the

the

the

the

you

a

of

the

been
created
for

notice
that

from
the

imagined

to
be
some
monstrous
animal
of

form
even

the

sufficiently
curious
however
erroneous
it
may
now
be
considered
the
theory
of
creation
held
during
the
middle
ages
was
both
beautiful
and
noble
and
in
a
fairly
accurate
manner
may
be
summarized
as
follows
on
the
fall
of
the
tenth
legion
of
the
citizens
of
heaven
god
resolved
to
create
man
to
take
the
place
of
the
fallen
angels
he
evolved
this
world
for
the
home
of
the
new
creation
and
all
things
that
he
then
made
the
celestial
bodies
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
were
formed
solely
and
entirely
for
man
alone
as
the
centre
round
which
the
whole
of
creation
revolved
there
was
no
idea
then
that
the
world
in
which
man
was
placed
formed
only
one
of
many
such
inhabited
homes
and
that
our
sphere
was
simply
an
insignificant
fragment
of
a
vast
universe
the
celestial
bodies
it
was
held
were
created
not
only
to
give
light
and
heat
to
generate
metals
and
precious
stones
but
to
govern
the
affairs
of
men
and
enable
them
to
foretell
events
the
vegetable
kingdom
was
to
furnish
food
and
medicine
not
only
for
man
s
body
but
likewise
for
his
mind
lastly
the
animal
creation
provided
him
with
servants
with
food
for
his
bodily
wants
and
with
moral
lessons
and
examples
for
those
of
his
soul
this
i
venture
to
advance
as
a
tolerably
accurate
summary
of
the
theory
of
creation
held
during
the
middle
ages
and
until
nearly
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
if
correct
it
will
appear
from
it
that
each
part
of
creation
was
viewed
not
only
in
an
outward
and
material
manner
but
also
in
an
interior
and
spiritual

remarks
very

that
the

are
infinitely
worse
and
lower
than
those
which
are

in
real

slay

eat

prey
to
satisfy

there

he
has
never

created
such
an

as

the

or
the

was
one
of

that
was

and
was
evidently
so
well
under
observation
that
it
is
remarkable
how
such
erroneous
ideas
concerning
it
could
have
become
current
or
stood
their
ground
as
articles
of
belief
even
for
a
day
at
a
state
banquet
given
by
gaston
the
fifth
we
read
that
there
was
brought
in
for
an
enter
course
the
shape
of
a
beast
called
a
tiger
which
by
cunning
art
disgorged

is

the
author
was
a
neapolitan
the

is
divided
into
what
is
called
twenty
books
equivalent
really
to
chapters
and
they
receive
various
headings
according
to
their
contents
but
the
twentieth
porta
calls
chaos
and
he
explains
it
by
saying
i
determined
from
the
beginning
of
my
book
to
unite
experiments
that
are
contained
in
all
natural
sciences
but
by
my
business
that
called
me
off
my
mind
was
hindered
so
that
i
could
not
accomplish
what
i
attended
since
therefore
i
could
not
do
what
i
would
i
must
be
willing
to
do
what
i
can
therefore
i
shut
up
in
this
book
those
experiments
that
could
be
included
in
no
classes
which
were
so
diverse
and
various
that
they
could
not
make
up
a
science
or
a
book
and
therefore
i
have
here
them
altogether
confusedly
as
what
i
had
over
passed
and
if
god
please
i
will
another
time
give
you
a
more
perfect
book
now
you
must
rest
content
with
these
we
see
this
notion
so
lately
as
in
a
book
entitled
an
english
expositour
issued
in
by
john
hayes
printer
to
the
university
of
cambridge
the
northern
peoples
believed
also
in

enormous
wolf
called
fernris
who
was
the
offspring
of
loki
the
evil
principle
this
creature
until
the
end
of
the
world
would
be
the
cause
of
unnumbered
ills
to
humanity
but
at
the
crack
of
doom
would
after
a
fearful
struggle
be
vanquished
by
the
gods
and
a
reign
of
universal
peace
would
succeed
his
overthrow
wherefore
studious
readers
accept
my
long
labours
that
cost

much

there
be
so
many
strange
creatures
to
be
now
seen
collected
by
john
tradescant
who
keeps
them
carefully
and
methodically
at
his
house
near
to
lambeth
i
will
tell
you
some
of
the
wonders
you
may
now
see
and
not
till
then
believe
unless
you
think
fit
you
may

there
the

the

the

the
coney

the

fish
the
shark
the
poison
fish
the

and
not

incredible

but
you
may
there
see
the

several
sorts
of
barnacles
of
solan

and
the
bird
of

such
sorts
of
snakes
and
such
birds

and
of
so
various
forms
and
so
wonderfully
made
as
may
beget
wonder
and
amazement

walton

strange

charles

with
archbishop
laud
and

visited

to
its

and
we
find
in
evelyn

th
that
he
too
visited
it
the
brothers
tradescant
were
the
first
well
known
collectors
of
natural
curiosities
in
england
and
portraits
of
them
may
be
seen
in
the
ashmolean
museum
at

the
tradescant
collection

transferred
to

called

the
eastern
love
of
the
wonderful

be
readily
seen
in
the
well
known
arabian

in
the

and
in
oriental
literature
generally
mohammed
tells
us
in
his
sacred
book
that
he
saw
in
heaven
infinite
companies
of
angels
each
a
thousand
times
bigger
than
the
globe
of
the
earth
each
had
ten
thousand
heads
every
head
threescore
and
ten
thousand
tongues
and
every
one
of
those
tongues
praised
god
in
seven
hundred
thousand
languages
the
throne
of
allah
was
supported
by
seven
angels
each
so
great
that
a
falcon
if
he
were
to
fly
a
thousand
years
could
not
get
so
far
as
the
distance
from
one
of
their
eyes
to
the
other
gabriel
the
doorkeeper
of
paradise
has
seventy
thousand
keys
which
pertain
to
his
office
every
key
being
seven
thousand
miles
long
this
exaggerated
balderdash
is
but
childish
stuff
it
contains
no
element
of
grandeur
or
sublimity
and
in
reading
it
one
only
wonders
when
astonishment
and
awe
were
to
be
excited
by
an
artifice
so
commonplace
that
while
he
was
about
it
all
the
numbers
were
not
doubled
quadrupled
multiplied
ten
or
a
hundred
fold
so
that
we
finally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
with
all
the
arithmetical
possibilities
open
to
him
he
was
but
a
poor
bungler

his
business

wrote
in

it
is
curious
that
until
this
species
was
discovered
at
the
antipodes
a
black
swan
was
regarded
both
by
ancient
and
medi
val
writers
as
the
very
emblem
and
type
of
extravagant
impossibility
so
that
those
who
found
no
difficulty
in
believing
in
centaurs
mermaids
and
fifty
other
extravagances
felt
that
they
really
must
draw
the
line

this
in

read
that
the

of
anne
queen
of
richard
ii
was
an
ostrich
with
a
nayle
in
his
beake
thalaba
while
actual
incorporation
was
doubtless
regarded
as
the
most
effectual
mere
possession
was
not
by
any
means
to
be
despised
thus
porta
tells
us
that
if
you
would
have
a
man
become
bold
and
impudent
let
him
carry
about
him
the
skin
or
eyes
of
a
lion
or
a
cock
and
he
will
be
fearlesse
of
his
enemies
nay
he
will
be
very
terrible
unto
them
scores
of
equally
valuable
hints
may
be
gathered
from
these
old
authors
in
another
book
we
consulted
notes
for
cookerie
gathered
from
experienced
cookes
published
in
it
is
equally
emphatic
that
a
cock
to
be
stewed
to
renew
the

must
be
a
red
one
there
is
naturally
here
a
connection
suggested
between
the
colour
of
the

and
the
ruddy
hue
of

swallow
was
a
very
popular
one
the
chelidonium
or
swallow
wort
according
to
aristotle
and
dioscorides
was
so
called
because
the
swallows
use
it
to

too
well
known
to
need

theocritus
in
his
seventh

dwells
on
it

it
is

editions

one
that
came
under
our
notice
is
the
third
it
is
dated
ammianus
marcellinus
has
put
it
upon
record
that
in
imitation
of
the
ingenuity
of
the
crane
in
assuring
vigilance
alexander
the
great
was
accustomed
to
rest
with
a
silver
ball
in
his
hand
so
that
on
the
slightest
movement
it
might
fall
and
wake
him
this
is
certainly
heroic
treatment
since
even
such
an
one
as
alexander
might
fairly
claim
the
necessity
that
other
mortals
feel
of
uninterrupted
rest
it
reminds
one
of
the
dictum

a
viper
drowned
in
a
bowl
of
wine
gave
the
draught
great
healing
virtues
for
leprosy
this
happy
discovery
like
many
others
of
still
greater
value
was
the
result
of
accident
some
mowers
found
on
going
to
their
provisions
that
a
viper
had
got
into
the
wine
so
they
very
naturally
contented
themselves
with
water
but
when
they
had
finished
their
day
s
work
and
were
to
go
out
of
the
field
as
it
were
out
of
pity
they
gave
a
leprous
man
the
wine
wherein
the
viper
was
drowned
supposing
it
better
for
him
to
die
than
to
live
on
in
that
misery
but
he
when
he
had
drank
it
was
miraculously
cured
at
least
so
we
read
in
the
miracles
of
art
and
nature
galen
being
referred
to
as
the
original
authority
for
the
story
the
first
essential
in
many
of
these
ancient
remedies
appeared
to
be
that
they
should
be
most
improbable
and
unreasonable
and
secondly
that
they
should
be
as
repulsive
as
possible
spenser
in
the
ceremonies
to
be
observed
at
the
coronation
of
his
most
excellent
majesty
king
george
iv
the
order
of
the
procession

given

first
item
of

as

and

there
is
a
notion
in
cheshire
that
this
complaint
can
be
cured
by
holding
a
toad
or
frog
for
a
few
minutes
within
the
child
s
mouth
at
the
imminent
risk
one
would
imagine
of
choking
the
patient
in
norfolk
they
had
greater
faith
in
giving
the
child
milk
to
drink
that
a
ferret
had
previously
lapped
at
the
knops
or
heads

holow

and
for
the
most
part

in

which

not
being
aware
of
the
various
stages
of
egg

and

through
which
butterflies
and

pass
is
much
perplexed
over
the

whether
i
may

a

he
says
i
cannot
tell
for
sometimes
it
is
a

sometimes
a

sometimes
neither

a

and
many

that
set
our

wondering
in
fear
and
amazement
as
to
what
such
portents
should
signify
to
be
shewn
at
the
royal
infirmary
of

largest
and
most
beautiful

that
was

by

likewise
a

large

which
all
connoisseurs
acknowledge
to
be
a
remarkable
curiosity

as
the
money
collected
on
this
occasion
is
to
be
applied
solely
for
the
relief
of
the
indigent
sick
in

said
hospital

of

shall

edinburgh
chronicle
in
the
travels
of
boullaye
le
gouz
published
in
we
find
a
reference
to
this
notion
he
says
i
had
among
my
baggage
the
hand
of
a
syren
or
fisherwoman
which
i
threw
on
the
sly
into
the
sea
because
the
captain
seeing
that
we
could
not
make
way
asked
me
if
i
had
not
got
some
mummy
or
other
in
my
bags
which
hindered
our
progress
in
which
case
we
must
return
to
egypt
to
carry
it
back
again
most
of
the
proven
als
have
the
opinion
that
the
vessels
which
transport
the
mummies
from
egypt
have
great
difficulty
in
arriving
safe
at
port
so
that
i
feared
lest
coming
to
search
my
goods
they
might
take
the
hand
of
this
fish
for
a
mummy
s
hand
and
insult
me
on
account
of
it
that
dolphins
are
crooked
is
not
only
affirmed
by
the
hand
of
the
painter
but
commonly
conceived
their
naturall
or
proper
figure
which
is
not
only
the
opinion
of
our
times
but
seems
the
belief
of
older
times
before
us
for
besides
the
expressions
of
ovid
and
pliny
their
portraicts
in
ancient
coynes
are
framed
in
this
figure
as
will
appear
in
some
thereof
in
gesner
others
in
goltzius
and
l
vinus
hulsius
in
his
description
of
coynes
notwithstanding
to
speak
strictly
in
their
naturall
figure
they
are
streight
nor
have
they
their
spine
convexed
or
more
considerably
embowed
than
sharkes
porposes
or
whales
and
therefore
what
is
delivered
of
their
incurvity
must
either
be
taken
emphatically
that
is
not
really
but
in
appearance
which
happeneth
when
they
leap
above
water
or
suddenly
shoot
down
again
which
is
a
fallacy
of
vision
whereby
streight
bodies
in
a
sudden
motion
protruded
obliquely
downward
appear
to
the
eye
crooked
and
this
is
the
construction
of
bellonius
or
if
it
be
taken
really
it
must
not
be
universally
and
perpetually
that
is
not
when
they
swimme
and
remaine
in
their
proper
figures
but
only
when
they
leape
or
impetuously
whirle
their
bodies
anyway
and
this
is
the
opinion
of
gesnerus
or
lastly
it
must
be
taken
neither
really
nor
emphatically
but
only
emblematically
for
being
the
hieroglyphic
of
celerity
and
swifter
than
other
animalls
men
best
expressed
their
velocity
by
incurvity
and
under
some
figure
of
a
bowe
and
in
this
sense
probably
do
heralds
also
